Jersey was the main technology I learnt and utilized during my 4 years at Yahoo.

As a reference implementation of [JAX-RS](https://github.com/QubitPi/Opinionated-JAX-RS-Spec), Jersey has been the
industry standard for developing RESTful Webservices.

It is a technology that enjoys a broad range of support from Java communities (JavaEE, Hibernate, and etc...) and
standards; it is an art that I love to practice; and it is absolutely a necessity for you to learn. That is the
motivation of this series of blogs - make Jersey easy for people to learn(it's very easy, believe me üòâ) and let
people love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
