\chapter{What is Design and Architecture?}

\section{What is a Good Architecture?}

\begin{marker}
The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.
\end{marker}

The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet
the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad.

Why keeping effort low is important? When the stakeholders change their minds about a feature, that change should be simple and easy to make. The difficulty in making such a change should be proportional only to the scope of the change, and not to the shape of the change.

It is this difference between scope and shape that often drives the growth in software development costs. It is the reason that costs grow out of proportion to the size of the requested changes. It is the reason that the first year of development is much cheaper than the second, and the second year is much cheaper than the third.
