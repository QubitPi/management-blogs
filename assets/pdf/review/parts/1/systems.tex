\section{Scaling Up}\index{Systems!Scaling Up}

The hard part of enterprise applications is all about scaling up while making the code clean. A system \textbf{architecture} must allow scalability and extensabilities too. How do we make that happen?

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, colback=green!10!white, colframe=green!85!black]
Software systems are unique compared to physical systems. Their architectures can grow
incrementally, \textbf{if} we maintain the proper separation of concerns.
\end{tcolorbox}

Certainly, \textit{separation of concerns} is the most important topic we shall discuss to make a clean, extensable, and scalable system below.

Reviewing code of an initial system needs extra effort on evaluating Separation of Concerns.

\subsection{Approaches for Separation of Concerns}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dependency Injection
    \item Factory Pattern
