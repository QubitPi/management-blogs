\chapter{You Are Partially Responsible for the Code}

Responsibility is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment, by reviewing code, to ensure that something is done right, but you don’t necessarily
have direct control over every aspect of it. In addition to doing your own
personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks that are beyond
your control.

When you do accept the responsibility(because you are reviewing) for some codes, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you see a mistake (as all programmers do) or an error in judgment, speak it out honestly and try to offer options for code authors.

Don’t blame someone or something else, it is up to you to provide solutions.
