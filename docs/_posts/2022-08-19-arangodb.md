Data Model & Concepts
---------------------

### Databases, Collections and Documents

**Databases** are sets of collections. **Collections** store records, which are referred to as **documents**.
Collections are the equivalent of tables in RDBMS, and documents can be thought of as rows in a table. The difference is 
that we don't define what columns (or rather attributes) there will be in advance. Every document in any collection can 
have arbitrary attribute keys and values. **Documents in a single collection will likely have a similar structure in 
practice** however, but the database system itself does not impose it and will operate stable and fast no matter how your 
data looks like.

#### Database

ArangoDB can handle multiple databases in the same server instance. Databases can be used to logically group and
separate data. An ArangoDB database consists of collections and dedicated database-specific worker processes.

A database contains its own collections (which cannot be accessed from other databases)

There will always be at least one database in ArangoDB. This is the default database, named **_system**. This database 
cannot be dropped, and provides special operations for creating, dropping, and enumerating databases. Users can create 
additional databases and give them unique names to access them later. Database management operations cannot be initiated 
from out of user-defined databases.

> When ArangoDB is accessed via its HTTP REST API, the database name is read from the first part of the request URI path 
> (e.g. "/_db/myDB/"). If the request URI does not contain a database name, it defaults to "/_db/_system". If a database 
> name is provided in the request URI, the name must be properly URL-encoded, and, if it contains UTF-8 characters,
> these must be NFC-normalized. Any non-NFC-normalized database name will be rejected by arangod.

##### Database Name

Each database must be given a unique name. This name is used to uniquely identify a database.

There are two naming conventions available for database names

1. the **traditional**
   - Database names must only consist of the letters "a" to "z" (both lower and upper case allowed), the numbers 0 to 9, and the underscore (_) or dash (-) symbols. This also means that any non-ASCII database names are not allowed.
   - Database names must always start with a letter. Database names starting with an underscore are considered to be 
     system databases; users should not create or delete those. The maximum allowed length of a database name is 64
     bytes.
   - Database names are case-sensitive.
2. the **extended** naming conventions
   - Names can consist of most UTF-8 characters, such as Japanese or Arabic letters, emojis, letters with accentuation. 
     Some ASCII characters are disallowed, though. Valid examples are "Espa√±a", "üòÄ", "Áä¨", "@abc123", "K√∏benhavn", 
     "M√ºnchen", "–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è", "abc? <> 123!"
   - Names cannot contain the characters `/` or `:` at any position, nor any control characters (below ASCII code 32), such as `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, and `\0`.
   - Spaces are accepted, but only in between characters of the name. Leading or trailing spaces are not allowed.
   - `.` (dot), `_` (underscore) and the numeric digits 0-9 are not allowed as first character, but at later positions.
   - Database names are case sensitive.
   - Database names containing UTF-8 characters must be
     [NFC-normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normal_forms).
   - The maximum length of a database name is 128 bytes after normalization. As a UTF-8 character may consist of
     multiple bytes, this does not necessarily equate to 128 characters.

Whether the former or the latter is active depends upon the value of the startup flag
`--database.extended-names-databases`. Starting the server with this flag set to `true` will activate the extended
naming convention, which tolerates names with special and UTF-8 characters. If the flag is set to `false` (the default 
value), the traditional naming convention is activated.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While it is possible to change the value of the `--database.extended-names-databases` option from `false` to `true`
> to enable extended names, the reverse is not true. Once the extended names have been enabled they will remain 
> permanently enabled so that existing databases with extended names remain accessible.

### Database Interaction

ArangoDB is a database that serves JSON documents. The [web interface](#web-interface) we just saw is called
**Aardvark**. There is also an interactive shell, called **Arangosh**, for developers. In addition, there are
[drivers](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/drivers/index.html) that provides programmatic access to different
languages, such as Java.

### Data model

### Document

The documents you can store in ArangoDB closely follow the JSON format, although they are **stored in a binary format
called [VelocyPack](https://github.com/arangodb/velocypack#readme)**, which is the same thing as JSON with offering
_more efficient storage and data manipulation_. **A document contains zero or more attributes**, each of these
attributesvhaving a value. A value can either be an atomic type, i. e. number, string, boolean or null, or a compound
type, i.e. an array or embedded document/object. Arrays and sub-objects can contain all of these types, which means that
arbitrarily nested data structures can be represented in a single document.

#### Document Example

Here is an example document record stored in ArangoDB:

```json
{
    "_id":"persons/alice",
    "_key":"alice",
    "_rev":"_cZCenLi---",
    "name":"Alice"
}
```

#### Document Key

A document key is a string that uniquely identifies a document **in a given collection**. Document keys are stored in
the `_key` attribute of documents. The key values are automatically indexed by ArangoDB in a collection's primary index.
The `_key` value of a document is immutable once the document has been created.

##### Key v.s ID

You probably see the difference in the [example above](#document-example). The `_key` is the "ID" of a collection,
whereas the `_id` is the "ID" of entire database and is unique across all collections within that database. Note the
difference is that `_id` is prefixed with a collection name (e.g. "person")

### Collection

Documents are grouped into collections. **A collection contains zero or more documents**. If you are familiar with
relational database management systems (RDBMS) then it is safe to compare collections to tables and documents to rows.
The difference is that in a traditional RDBMS, you have to define columns before you can store records in a table. Such
definitions are also known as _schemas_. _ArangoDB is by default schema-less_, which means that there is no need to
define what attributes a document can have. Every single document can have a completely different structure and still be
stored together with other documents in a single collection.

There are two types of collections

1. **document collection** - also refered to as vertex collections in the context of graphs)
2. **edge collections** - store documents as well, but they include two special attributes, _from and _to, which are
   used to create relations between documents. Usually, two documents (vertices) stored in document collections are
   linked by a document (edge) stored in an edge collection.

### Database

Collections are stored in databases. There can be one or many databases. The default database `_system` is special,
because it cannot be removed. Database users are managed in this database

### Query

Queries are used to

* filter documents based on certain criteria,
* compute new data,
* manipulate or delete existing documents.

ArangoDB query is written in [ArangoDB Query Language (AQL)](#arangodb-query-language-aql).

#### Cursor

Cursors are used to iterate over the result of queries, so that you get easily processable batches instead of one big
chunk.

### Index

Indexes allow fast access to documents, provided the indexed attribute(s) are used in a query. While **ArangoDB
automatically indexes some system attributes, including `_id`, `_key`, `_from` and `_to`**, users are free to create extra indexes on non-system attributes of
documents.

User-defined indexes can be created on collection level. Most user-defined indexes can be created by specifying the
names of the index attributes. Some index types allow indexing just one attribute (e.g. fulltext index) whereas other
index types allow indexing multiple attributes at the same time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Creating new indexes requires exclusive locking on collection. The collection is not available while the index is
> being created. This could be undesirable if you have to perform it on an on-flight application without a dedicated
> maintenance window.

#### Primary Index

**Each collection** has a primary index which is a persistent index for the document keys (`_key` attribute) of all
documents in the collection. _The primary index allows quick selection of documents in the collection using either the
`_key` or `_id` attributes_.

* [Passwordless login - `ARANGO_NO_AUTH=1`](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/deployment-single-instance-manual-start.html#authentication)
* [Run container](https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/docker/):

  docker run -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=openSesame arangodb/arangodb:3.8.1


Java API
--------

### Get Collection Size

```java
arangoDb.db(databaseName).collection(collectionName).count().getCount();
```

### Troubleshooting

#### [Always Check for DB Existence Before Executing Query](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb-java-driver/issues/254)

Otherwise a runtime exception will break the application with the following error: 

```
Cause:class com.arangodb.ArangoDBException --> Msg:Response: 404, Error: 1228 - database not found
com.arangodb.ArangoDBException: Response: 404, Error: 1228 - database not found
```

We should make sure the table exists before executing query using, for example:

```java
ArangoDatabase db = ...

if (!db.exists()) {
    // execute logic on non-existing databases
}
```


Command Line Reference
----------------------

### Drop a Database

`db._dropDatabase(name)` statement is used to drop a database. You can drop the database only within the `_system`
database and the `_system` database can't be deleted.

1. Login to arango shell.

       $arangosh
       Please specify a password:
       
                                              _     
       __ _ _ __ __ _ _ __   __ _  ___  ___| |__  
       / _` | '__/ _` | '_ \ / _` |/ _ \/ __| '_ \
       | (_| | | | (_| | | | | (_| | (_) \__ \ | | |
       \__,_|_|  \__,_|_| |_|\__, |\___/|___/_| |_|
       |___/
       
       arangosh (ArangoDB 3.7.11 [darwin] 64bit, using build , VPack 0.1.33, RocksDB 6.8.0, ICU 64.2, V8 7.9.317, OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021)
       Copyright (c) ArangoDB GmbH
       
       Command-line history will be persisted when the shell is exited. You can use `--console.history false` to turn this off
       Connected to ArangoDB 'http+tcp://127.0.0.1:8529, version: 3.7.11 [SINGLE, server], database: '_system', username: 'root'
       
       Type 'tutorial' for a tutorial or 'help' to see common examples
       127.0.0.1:8529@_system>

2. List all the databases.

       127.0.0.1:8529@_system> db._databases()
       [
       "_system",
       "demodb",
       "example"
       ]

3. Drop the database demodb.

       127.0.0.1:8529@_system> db._dropDatabase ("demodb")

Dropping a database is an asynchronous operation. Database is physically removed once all clients are disconnected and
references have been garbage-collected.




Web Interface
-------------

The ArangoDB server (arangod) comes with a built-in web interface for administration. It lets you manage databases,
collections, documents, users, graphs and more. You can also run and explain queries in a convenient way. Statistics and
server status are provided as well.

The Web Interface (also Web UI, frontend or **Aardvark**) can be accessed with a browser under the URL
http://localhost:8529 with default server settings.

The interface differs for standalone instances and cluster setups.

Standalone:

![Error loading arango-ui-standalone.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-standalone.png" | relative_url}})

Cluster:

![Error loading arango-ui-cluster.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-cluster.png" | relative_url}})

### Dashboard

The Dashboard tab provides statistics which are polled regularly from the ArangoDB server.

![Error arango-ui-dashboard.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-dashboard.png" | relative_url}})

Requests Statistics:

* Requests per second
* Request types
* Number of client connections
* Transfer size
* Transfer size (distribution)
* Average request time
* Average request time (distribution)

System Resources:

* Number of threads
* Memory
* Virtual size
* Major page faults
* Used CPU time

Replication:

* Replication state
* Totals
* Ticks
* Progress

### Cluster

The cluster section displays statistics about the general cluster performance.

![Error arango-ui-cluster.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-cluster.png" | relative_url}})

Statistics:

* Available and missing Coordinators
* Available and missing DB-Servers
* Memory usage (percent)
* Current connections
* Data (bytes)
* HTTP (bytes)
* Average request time (seconds)

#### Nodes

##### Overview

The overview shows available and missing Coordinators and DB-Servers.

![Error arango-ui-nodes.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-nodes.png" | relative_url}})

##### Shards

The shard section displays all available sharded collections.

![Error arango-ui-shards.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-shards.png" | relative_url}})

##### Rebalance Shards

The rebalance shards section displays a button for rebalancing shards. A new DB-Server will not have any shards. With
the rebalance functionality, the cluster will start to rebalance shards including empty DB-Servers. You can specify the 
maximum number of shards that can be moved in each operation by using the `--cluster.max-number-of-move-shards` startup 
option of arangod (the default value is 10). When the button is clicked, the number of scheduled move shards operations
is shown, or it is displayed that no move operations have been scheduled if they are not necessary.
