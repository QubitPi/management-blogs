## Plugins

JMeter comes with lots of "3rd party" plugins that are available through
[JMeter Plugins Manager](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/). After
[installing it](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/#Installation-and-Usage), we could, for example, install
a very important plugin, which is jpgc (search "jpgc" in "Available Plugins"). It tells you the number of
transactions/requests per seconds, which is a hint of service performance:

![Error loading jpgc-example.png!]({{ "/assets/img/jpgc-example.png" | relative_url}})

## Command Line

To run a test-plan file from command line

    apache-jmeter-5.4.1/bin/jmeter -n -t test-file.jmx
