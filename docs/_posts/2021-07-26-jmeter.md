## Plugins

JMeter comes with lots of "3rd party" plugins that are available through
[JMeter Plugins Manager](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/). After
[installing it](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/#Installation-and-Usage), we could, for example, install
a very important plugin, which is jpgc (search "jpgc" in "Available Plugins"). It tells you the number of
transactions/requests per seconds, which is a hint of service performance:

![Error loading jpgc-example.png!]({{ "/assets/img/jpgc-example.png" | relative_url}})

## Command Line

To run a test-plan file from command line

    apache-jmeter-x.x.x/bin/jmeter -n -t test-file.jmx -l aggreate-report.jtl -e -o html-report-directory/

* A log file `jmeter.log` will be generated in the same directory where the command above is executed.
* If "Aggregate Report" is enabled in the thread group, the report will be output as a text file whose name is
  `aggreate-report.jtl`
* When the command finished execution, the test plan result will be generated in the form in HTML, which is located
  under `html-report-directory/`
  
> 📋️ Note that the load test ends, the `jmeter.log` will prints the following line for signal
> ```
> 2021-07-28 12:53:10,959 INFO o.a.j.JMeter: Dashboard generated
> ```

The HTML report looks something like figure below:
