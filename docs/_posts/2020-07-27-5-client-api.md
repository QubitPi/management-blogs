This post introduces the JAX-RS Client API, which is a fluent Java based API for communication with RESTful Web
services. This standard API that is also part of Java EE 7 is designed to make it very easy to consume a Web service
exposed via HTTP protocol and enables developers to concisely and efficiently implement portable client-side solutions
that leverage existing and well established client-side HTTP connector implementations.

The JAX-RS client API can be utilized to consume any Web service exposed on top of a HTTP protocol or it's extension
(e.g. WebDAV), and is not restricted to services implemented using JAX-RS. Yet, developers familiar with JAX-RS should
find the client API complementary to their services, especially if the client API is utilized by those services
themselves, or to test those services. The JAX-RS client API finds inspiration in the proprietary Jersey 1.x Client API
and developers familiar with the Jersey 1.x Client API should find it easy to understand all the concepts introduced in
the new JAX-RS Client API. 

The goals of the client API are threefold: 

1. Encapsulate a key constraint of the REST architectural style, namely the Uniform Interface Constraint and associated
   data elements, as client-side Java artifacts;
2. Make it as easy to consume RESTful Web services exposed over HTTP, same as the JAX-RS server-side API makes it easy
   to develop RESTful Web services; and
3. Share common concepts and extensibility points of the JAX-RS API between the server and the client side programming
   models.
   
As an extension to the standard JAX-RS Client API, the Jersey Client API supports a pluggable architecture to enable the
use of different underlying HTTP client [Connector](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/spi/Connector.html) 
implementations. Several such implementations are currently provided with Jersey. We have a default client connector
using `Http(s)URLConnection` supplied with the JDK as well as connector implementations based on Apache HTTP Client,
Jetty HTTP client and Grizzly Asynchronous Client. 

## Uniform Interface Constraint

The uniform interface constraint bounds the architecture of RESTful Web services so that a client, such as a browser,
can utilize the same interface to communicate with any service. This is a very powerful concept in software engineering
that makes Web-based search engines and service mash-ups possible. It induces properties such as:

1. simplicity, the architecture is easier to understand and maintain; and
2. evolvability or loose coupling, clients and services can evolve over time perhaps in new and unexpected ways, while
   retaining backwards compatibility.

Further constraints are required: 

1. every resource is identified by a URI;
2. a client interacts with the resource via HTTP requests and responses using a fixed set of HTTP methods; 
3. one or more representations can be returned and are identified by media types; and
4. the contents of which can link to further resources.

The above process repeated over and again should be familiar to anyone who has used a browser to fill in HTML forms and
follow links. That same process is applicable to non-browser based clients.

Many existing Java-based client APIs, such as the Apache HTTP client API or `HttpUrlConnection` supplied with the JDK
place too much focus on the Client-Server constraint for the exchanges of request and responses rather than a resource,
identified by a URI, and the use of a fixed set of HTTP methods.

A resource in the JAX-RS client API is an instance of the Java class `WebTarget` and encapsulates an URI. The fixed set
of HTTP methods can be invoked based on the `WebTarget`. The representations are Java types, instances of which, may
contain links that new instances of `WebTarget` may be created from.

## Ease of use and reusing JAX-RS artifacts

Since a JAX-RS component is represented as an annotated Java type, it makes it easy to configure, pass around and inject
in ways that are not so intuitive or possible with other client-side APIs. The Jersey Client API reuses many aspects of
the JAX-RS and the Jersey implementation such as:

1. URI building using `UriBuilder` and [UriTemplate](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/uri/UriTemplate.html)
   to safely build URIs;
2. Built-in support for Java types of representations such as `byte[]`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Character`,
   `InputStream`, `java.io.Reader`, `File`, `DataSource`, JAXB beans as well as additional Jersey-specific JSON and
   [Multi Part](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/media/multipart/package-summary.html)
   support.
3. Using the fluent builder-style API pattern to make it easier to construct requests.

Some APIs, like the Apache HTTP Client or
[HttpURLConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html) can be rather hard to use
and/or require too much code to do something relatively simple, especially when the client needs to understand different
payload representations. This is why the Jersey implementation of JAX-RS Client API provides support for wrapping
`HttpUrlConnection` and the Apache HTTP client. Thus it is possible to get the benefits of the established JAX-RS
implementations and features while getting the ease of use benefit of the simple design of the JAX-RS client API. For
example, with a low-level HTTP client library, sending a POST request with a bunch of typed HTML form parameters and
receiving a response de-serialized into a JAXB bean is not straightforward at all. With the new JAX-RS Client API
supported by Jersey this task is very easy:

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget target = client.target("http://localhost:9998").path("resource");
 
Form form = new Form();
form.param("x", "foo");
form.param("y", "bar");
 
MyJAXBBean bean = target.request(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)
        .post(
                Entity.entity(form,MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_TYPE),
                MyJAXBBean.class
        );
```

In the example above, a new `WebTarget` instance is created using a new `Client` instance first, next a `Form` instance
is created with two form parameters. Once ready, the `Form` instance is `POST`ed to the target resource. First, the
acceptable media type is specified in the `request(...)` method. Then in the `post(...)` method, a call to a static
method on JAX-RS Entity is made to construct the request entity instance and attach the proper content media type to the
form entity that is being sent. The second parameter in the `post(...)` method specifies the Java type of the response
entity that should be returned from the method in case of a successful response. In this case an instance of JAXB bean
is requested to be returned on success. The Jersey client API takes care of selecting the proper
`MessageBodyWriter<T>` for the serialization of the Form instance, invoking the POST request and producing and
de-serialization of the response message payload into an instance of a JAXB bean using a proper `MessageBodyReader<T>`.

If the code above had to be written using `HttpUrlConnection`, the developer would have to write custom code to
serialize the form data that are sent within the POST request and de-serialize the response input stream into a JAXB
bean. Additionally, more code would have to be written to make it easy to reuse the logic when communicating with the
same resource `http://localhost:8080/resource` that is represented by the JAX-RS `WebTarget` instance in our example.

## Overview of the Client API

### Getting started with the client API

Refer to the [dependencies](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/07/24/2-modules-and-dependencies.html#common_jersey_use_cases)
for details on the dependencies when using the Jersey JAX-RS Client support.

You may also want to use a custom
[Connector](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/spi/Connector.html)
implementation. In such case you would need to include additional dependencies on the module(s) containing the custom
client connector that you want to use. See section "[Configuring custom Connectors](#client-transport-connectors)" about
how to use and configure a custom Jersey client transport `Connector`.

### Creating and configuring a Client instance

JAX-RS Client API is designed to allow fluent programming model. This means, a construction of a `Client` instance,
from which a `WebTarget` is created, from which a request `Invocation` is built and invoked can be chained in a single
"flow" of invocations. The individual steps of the flow will be shown in the following sections. To utilize the client
API it is first necessary to build an instance of a `Client` using one of the static `ClientBuilder` factory methods.
Here's the most simple example:

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
```

The `ClientBuilder` is a JAX-RS API used to create new instances of Client. In a slightly more advanced scenarios,
`ClientBuilder` can be used to configure additional client instance properties, such as a SSL transport settings, if
needed.

A `Client` instance can be configured during creation by passing a
[ClientConfig](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/ClientConfig.html)
to the `newClient(Configurable)` ClientBuilder factory method.
[ClientConfig](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/ClientConfig.html)
implements `Configurable` and therefore it offers methods to register providers (e.g. features or individual entity
providers, filters or interceptors) and setup properties. The following code shows a registration of custom client
filters:

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.register(MyClientResponseFilter.class);
clientConfig.register(new AnotherClientFilter());
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(clientConfig);
```

In the example, filters are registered using the `ClientConfig.register(...)` method. There are multiple overloaded
versions of the method that support registration of feature and provider classes or instances. Once a `ClientConfig`
instance is configured, it can be passed to the `ClientBuilder` to create a pre-configured `Client` instance.

Note that the Jersey `ClientConfig` supports the fluent API model of `Configurable`. With that the code that configures
a new client instance can be also written using a more compact style as shown below.  

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(
        new ClientConfig()
            .register(MyClientResponseFilter.class)
            .register(new AnotherClientFilter()
);
```

The ability to leverage this compact pattern is inherent to all JAX-RS and Jersey Client API components. 

Since `Client` implements `Configurable` interface too, it can be configured further even after it has been created.
Important is to mention that any configuration change done on a `Client` instance will not influence the `ClientConfig`
instance that was used to provide the initial `Client` instance configuration at the instance creation time. The next
piece of code shows a configuration of an existing `Client` instance.

```java
client.register(ThirdClientFilter.class);
```

Similarly to earlier examples, since `Client.register(...)` method supports the fluent API style, multiple client
instance configuration calls can be chained: 

```java
client.register(FilterA.class)
        .register(new FilterB())
        .property("my-property", true);
```

To get the current configuration of the `Client` instance a `getConfiguration()` method can be used.

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.register(MyClientResponseFilter.class);
clientConfig.register(new AnotherClientFilter());
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(clientConfig);
client.register(ThirdClientFilter.class);
Configuration newConfiguration = client.getConfiguration();
```

In the code, an additional `MyClientResponseFilter` class and `AnotherClientFilter` instance are registered in the
`clientConfig`. The `clientConfig` is then used to construct a new `Client` instance. The `ThirdClientFilter` is added
separately to the constructed `Client` instance. This does not influence the configuration represented by the original
`clientConfig`. ***In the last step a `newConfiguration` is retrieved from the client. This configuration contains all
three registered filters while the original `clientConfig` instance still contains only two filters***. Unlike
`clientConfig` created separately, the `newConfiguration` retrieved from the `client` instance represents a live
client configuration view. ***Any additional configuration changes made to the `client` instance are also reflected in
the `newConfiguration`. So, `newConfiguration` is really a view of the `client` configuration and not a configuration
state copy. These principles are important in the client API and will be used in the following sections too. For
example, you can construct a common base configuration for all clients (in our case it would be `clientConfig`) and then
reuse this common configuration instance to configure multiple `client` instances that can be further specialized.
Similarly, you can use an existing `client` instance configuration to configure another client instance without having
to worry about any side effects in the original `client` instance.

### Targeting a web resource

Once you have a `Client` instance you can create a `WebTarget` from it.

```java
WebTarget webTarget = client.target("http://example.com/rest");
```

A `Client` contains several `target(...)` methods that allow for creation of `WebTarget` instance. In this case we're
using `target(String uri)` version. The `uri` passed to the method as a `String` is the URI of the targeted web
resource. In more complex scenarios it could be the context root URI of the whole RESTful application, from which
`WebTarget` instances representing individual resource targets can be derived and individually configured. This is
possible, because JAX-RS `WebTarget` also implements `Configurable`:

```java
WebTarget webTarget = client.target("http://example.com/rest");
webTarget.register(FilterForExampleCom.class);
``` 

The configuration principles used in JAX-RS client API apply to `WebTarget` as well. Each `WebTarget` instance inherits
a configuration from its parent (either a client or another web target) and can be further custom-configured without
affecting the configuration of the parent component. In this case, the `FilterForExampleCom` will be registered only in
the `webTarget` and not in `client`. So, the `client` can still be used to create new `WebTarget` instances pointing at
other URIs using just the common client configuration, which `FilterForExampleCom` filter is not part of.

### Identifying resource on WebTarget

Let's assume we have a `webTarget` pointing at `"http://example.com/rest"` URI that represents a context root of a
RESTful application and there is a resource exposed on the URI `"http://example.com/rest/resource"`. As already
mentioned, a `WebTarget` instance can be used to derive other web targets. Use the following code to define a path to
the resource.

```java
WebTarget resourceWebTarget = webTarget.path("resource");
```

The `resourceWebTarget` now points to the resource on URI `"http://example.com/rest/resource"`. Again if we configure
the `resourceWebTarget` with a filter specific to the resource, it will not influence the original `webTarget` instance.
However, the filter `FilterForExampleCom` registration will still be inherited by the `resourceWebTarget` as it has been
created from `webTarget`. This mechanism allows you to share the common configuration of related resources (typically
hosted under the same URI root, in our case represented by the `webTarget` instance), while allowing for further
configuration specialization based on the specific requirements of each individual resource. The same configuration
principles of inheritance (to allow common config propagation) and decoupling (to allow individual config customization)
applies to all components in JAX-RS Client API discussed below. 

Let's say there is a sub resource on the path `"http://example.com/rest/resource/helloworld"`. You can derive a
`WebTarget` for this resource simply by:

```java
WebTarget helloworldWebTarget = resourceWebTarget.path("helloworld");
```

Let's assume that the `helloworld` resource accepts a query param for GET requests which defines the greeting message.
The next code snippet shows a code that creates a new `WebTarget` with the query param defined.

```java
WebTarget helloworldWebTargetWithQueryParam =
        helloworldWebTarget.queryParam("greeting", "Hi World!");
```

Please note that apart from methods that can derive new `WebTarget` instance based on a URI path or query parameters,
the JAX-RS `WebTarget` API contains also methods for working with matrix parameters too.

### Invoking a HTTP request

Let's now focus on invoking a GET HTTP request on the created web targets. To start building a new HTTP request
invocation, we need to create a new `Invocation.Builder`.

```java
Invocation.Builder invocationBuilder =
        helloworldWebTargetWithQueryParam.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE);
invocationBuilder.header("some-header", "true");
```

A new invocation builder instance is created using one of the `request(...)` methods that are available on `WebTarget`.
A couple of these methods accept parameters that let you define the media type of the representation requested to be
returned from the resource. Here we are saying that we request a `"text/plain"` type. This tells Jersey to add a
`Accept: text/plain` HTTP header to our request.

The `invocationBuilder` is used to setup request specific parameters. Here we can setup headers for the request or for
example cookie parameters. In our example we set up a `"some-header"` header to value `true`.

Once finished with request customizations, it's time to invoke the request. We have two options now. We can use the
`Invocation.Builder` to build a generic `Invocation` instance that will be invoked some time later. Using `Invocation`
we will be able to e.g. set additional request properties which are properties in a batch of several requests and use
the generic JAX-RS `Invocation` API to invoke the batch of requests without actually knowing all the details (such as
request HTTP method, configuration etc.). Any properties set on an invocation instance can be read during the request
processing. For example, in a custom `ClientRequestFilter` you can call `getProperty()` method on the supplied
`ClientRequestContext` to read a request property. Note that these request properties are different from the
configuration properties set on `Configurable`. As mentioned earlier, an `Invocation` instance provides generic
invocation API to invoke the HTTP request it represents either synchronously or asynchronously. See 
[Asynchronous Services and Clients](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/08/02/11-asynchronous-services-and-clients.html)
for more information on asynchronous invocations.  

In case you do not want to do any batch processing on your HTTP request invocations prior to invoking them, there is
another, more convenient approach that you can use to invoke your requests directly from an `Invocation.Builder`
instance:

```java
Response response = invocationBuilder.get();
```

While short, the code in the example performs multiple actions. First, it will build the the request from the
`invocationBuilder`. The URI of request will be `http://example.com/rest/resource/helloworld?greeting="Hi%20World!"` and
the request will contain `some-header: true` and `Accept: text/plain` headers. The request will then pass trough all
configured request filters (`AnotherClientFilter`, `ThirdClientFilter`, and `FilterForExampleCom`). Once processed by
the filters, the request will be sent to the remote resource. Let's say the resource then returns an HTTP 200 message
with a plain text response content that contains the value sent in the request `greeting` query parameter. Now we can
observe the returned response:

```java
System.out.println(response.getStatus());
System.out.println(response.readEntity(String.class));
```

which will produce the following output to the console:

```java
200
Hi World!
```

As we can see, the request was successfully processed (code 200) and returned an entity (representation) is
`"Hi World!"`. Note that since we have configured a `MyClientResponseFilter` in the resource target, when
`response.readEntity(String.class)` gets called, the response returned from the remote endpoint is passed through the
response filter chain (including the `MyClientResponseFilter`) and entity interceptor chain and at last a proper
`MessageBodyReader<T>` is located to read the response content bytes from the response stream into a Java `String`
instance. Check
[Filters and Interceptors](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/08/01/10-filters-and-interceptors.html)
to learn more about request and response filters and entity interceptors.

Imagine now that you would like to invoke a `POST` request but without any query parameters. You would simply use the
`helloworldWebTarget` instance created earlier and call the `post()` instead of `get()`.

```java
Response postResponse =
        helloworldWebTarget.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE)
                .post(Entity.entity("A string entity to be POSTed", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN));
``` 

### Example summary

The following code puts together the pieces used in the earlier examples. 

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.register(MyClientResponseFilter.class);
clientConfig.register(new AnotherClientFilter());
 
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(clientConfig);
client.register(ThirdClientFilter.class);
 
WebTarget webTarget = client.target("http://example.com/rest");
webTarget.register(FilterForExampleCom.class);
WebTarget resourceWebTarget = webTarget.path("resource");
WebTarget helloworldWebTarget = resourceWebTarget.path("helloworld");
WebTarget helloworldWebTargetWithQueryParam =
        helloworldWebTarget.queryParam("greeting", "Hi World!");
 
Invocation.Builder invocationBuilder =
        helloworldWebTargetWithQueryParam.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE);
invocationBuilder.header("some-header", "true");
 
Response response = invocationBuilder.get();
System.out.println(response.getStatus());
System.out.println(response.readEntity(String.class));
```

Now we can try to leverage the fluent API style to write this code in a more compact way.

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(new ClientConfig()
            .register(MyClientResponseFilter.class)
            .register(new AnotherClientFilter()));
 
String entity = client.target("http://example.com/rest")
            .register(FilterForExampleCom.class)
            .path("resource/helloworld")
            .queryParam("greeting", "Hi World!")
            .request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE)
            .header("some-header", "true")
            .get(String.class);
```

The code above does the same thing except it skips the generic `Response` processing and directly requests an entity in
the last `get(String.class)` method call. This shortcut method let's you specify that (in case the response was returned
successfully with a HTTP 2xx status code) the response entity should be returned as Java `String` type. This compact
example demonstrates another advantage of the JAX-RS client API. The fluency of JAX-RS Client API is convenient
especially with simple use cases. Here is another a very simple GET request returning a String representation (entity):

```java
String responseEntity = ClientBuilder.newClient()
            .target("http://example.com").path("resource/rest")
                        .request().get(String.class);
```

### Setting `ExecutorService` and `ScheduledExecutorService`

Some client invocations, like asynchronous or reactive, could lead to a need to start a new thread. This is being done
on provided `ExecutorService` or `ScheduledExecutorService`. `ClientBuilder` has two methods, which can be used to
define them: `executorService(ExecutorService)` and `scheduledExecutorService(ScheduledExecutorService)`. When
specified, all invocations which do require running on another thread, should be executed using provided services.

Default values do depend on the environment - in Java EE container, it has to be
[ManagedExecutorService](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/enterprise/concurrent/ManagedExecutorService.html)
and
[ManagedScheduledExecutorService](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/enterprise/concurrent/ManagedScheduledExecutorService.html),
for Java SE it would be `ForkJoinPool.commonPool` for Executor service and something undefined for Scheduled executor service.

```java
ExecutorService myExecutorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Client client = ClientBuilder.newBuilder().executorService(myExecutorService).build();
```

## Java instances and types for representations

All the Java types and representations supported by default on the Jersey server side for requests and responses are
also supported on the client side. For example, to process a response entity (or representation) as a stream of bytes
use `InputStream` as follows:

```java
InputStream in = response.readEntity(InputStream.class);
 
... // Read from the stream
 
in.close();
```

Note that it is important to close the stream after processing so that resources are freed up. 

To `POST` a file use a `File` instance as follows:

```java
File f = ...
 
...
 
webTarget.request().post(Entity.entity(f, MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE));
```

### Adding support for new representations

The support for new application-defined representations as Java types requires the implementation of the same JAX-RS
entity provider extension interfaces as for the server side JAX-RS API, namely `MessageBodyReader<T>` and
`MessageBodyWriter<T>` respectively, for request and response entities (or inbound and outbound representations).

Classes or implementations of the provider-based interfaces need to be registered as providers within the JAX-RS or
Jersey Client API components that implement `Configurable` contract (`ClientBuilder`, `Client`, `WebTarget` or
`ClientConfig`), as was shown in the earlier sections. Some media types are provided in the form of JAX-RS `Feature`, a
concept that allows the extension providers to group together multiple different extension providers and/or
configuration properties in order to simplify the registration and configuration of the provided feature by the end
users. For example,
[MoxyJsonFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/moxy/json/MoxyJsonFeature.html)
can be register to enable and configure JSON binding support via MOXy library. 

## Client Transport Connectors

By default, the transport layer in Jersey is provided by `HttpUrlConnection`. This transport is implemented in Jersey
via `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` that implements Jersey-specific
[Connector](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/spi/Connector.html)
SPI. You can implement and/or register your own `Connector` instance to the Jersey Client implementation, that will
replace the default `HttpUrlConnection`-based transport layer. Jersey provides several alternative client transport
connector implementations that are ready-to-use.

| Transport framework   | Jersey Connector implementation                                                                                                                                          | Maven dependency                                           |

**Warning**

Be aware of using other than default `Connector` implementation. There is an issue handling HTTP headers in
`WriterInterceptor` or `MessageBodyWriter<T>`. If you need to change header fields, do not use `ApacheConnectorProvider`
or `GrizzlyConnectorProvider` or `JettyConnectorProvider` or `NettyConnectorProvider`. The issue for example applies to
Jersey
[Multipart](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/07/31/09-support-for-common-media-type-representations.html)
feature that also modifies HTTP headers.

On the other hand, in the default transport connector, there are some restrictions on the headers that can be sent in
the default configuration. `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` uses `HttpUrlConnection` as an underlying connection
implementation. This JDK class by default restricts the use of following headers:

* `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
* `Access-Control-Request-Method`
* `Connection` (with one exception - `Connection` header with value `Closed` is allowed by default)
* `Content-Length`
* `Content-Transfer-Encoding`-
* `Host`
* `Keep-Alive`
* `Origin`
* `Trailer`
* `Transfer-Encoding`
* `Upgrade`
* `Via`
* all the headers starting with `Sec-`

The underlying connection can be configured to permit all headers to be sent, however this behaviour can be changed only
by setting the system property `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders`.


```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
System.setProperty("sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders", "true");

Response response = client.target(yourUri).path(yourPath).request()
        .header("Origin", "http://example.com")
        .header("Access-Control-Request-Method", "POST")
        .get();
```

Note, that internally the `HttpUrlConnection` instances are pooled, so (un)setting the property after already creating a
target typically does not have any effect. The property influences all the connections created after the property has
been (un)set, but there is no guarantee, that your request will use a connection created after the property change. 

In a simple environment, setting the property before creating the first target is sufficient, but in complex
environments (such as application servers), where some poolable connections might exist before your application even
bootstraps, this approach is not 100% reliable and we recommend using a different client transport connector, such as
Apache Connector. These limitations have to be considered especially when invoking CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
requests.

As indicated earlier,
[Connector](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/spi/Connector.html)
and
[ConnectorProvider](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/spi/ConnectorProvider.html)
contracts are Jersey-specific extension APIs that would only work with Jersey and as such are not part of JAX-RS.
Following example shows how to setup the custom Grizzly Asynchronous HTTP Client based on `ConnectorProvider` in a
Jersey client instance:

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.connectorProvider(new GrizzlyConnectorProvider());
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(clientConfig);
```

`ClientBuilder.newClinet(...)` accepts `Configurable` instance as its argument. Jersey implementation of the
`Configurable` is `ClientConfig`. By using the Jersey `ClientConfig` you can configure the custom `ConnectorProvider`
into the `ClientConfig`. The `GrizzlyConnectorProvider` is used as a custom connector provider in the example above.
Please note that the connector provider cannot be registered as a provider using `Configurable.register(...)`. Also,
please note that this API has changed in Jersey 2.5, where the `ConnectorProvider` SPI has been introduced in order to
decouple client initialization from the connector instantiation. Starting with Jersey 2.5 it is therefore not possible
to directly register `Connector` instances in the Jersey `ClientConfig`. The new `ConnectorProvider` SPI must be used
instead to configure a custom client-side transport connector. 

## Using client request and response filters

Filtering requests and responses can provide useful lower-level concept focused on a certain independent aspect or
domain that is decoupled from the application layer of building and sending requests, and processing responses. Filters
can read/modify the request URI, headers and entity or read/modify the response status, headers and entity. 

Jersey contains the following useful client-side filters (and features registering filters) that you may want to use in
your applications:

[CsrfProtectionFilter](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/filter/CsrfProtectionFilter.html):
Cross-site request forgery protection filter (adds `X-Requested-By` to each state changing request).
[EncodingFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/filter/EncodingFeature.html):
Feature that registers encoding filter which use registered
[ContentEncoder](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/spi/ContentEncoder.html)s
to encode and decode the communication. The encoding/decoding is performed in interceptor (you don't need to register
this interceptor). Check the javadoc of the
[EncodingFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/filter/EncodingFeature.html)
in order to use it.
[HttpAuthenticationFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/authentication/HttpAuthenticationFeature.html):
HTTP Authentication Feature.

Note that these features are provided by Jersey, but since they use and implement JAX-RS API, the features should be
portable and run in any JAX-RS implementation, not just Jersey. See
[Filters and Interceptors](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/08/01/10-filters-and-interceptors.html) for more
information on filters and interceptors.

## Closing connections

The underlying connections are opened for each request and ***closed after the response is received and entity is
processed (entity is read)***. See the following example:

```java
final WebTarget target = ... some web target
Response response = target.path("resource").request().get();
System.out.println("Connection is still open.");
System.out.println("string response: " + response.readEntity(String.class));
System.out.println("Now the connection is closed.");
```

***If you don't read the entity, then you need to close the response manually by `response.close()`. Also if the entity
is read into an `InputStream` (by `response.readEntity(InputStream.class)`), the connection stays open until you finish
reading from the `InputStream`. In that case, the `InputStream` or the `Response` should be closed manually at the end
of reading from InputStream***. 

## Injections into client providers

In some cases you might need to inject some custom types into your client provider instance. JAX-RS types do not need to
be injected as they are passed as arguments into API methods. Injections into client providers (filters, interceptor)
are possible as long as the provider is registered as a class. If the provider is registered as an instance then runtime
will not inject the provider. The reason is that this provider instance might be registered into multiple client
configurations. For example one instance of `ClientRequestFilter` can be registered to two `Clients`.

To solve injection of a custom type into a client provider instance use
[ServiceLocatorClientProvider](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/ServiceLocatorClientProvider.html)
to extract [ServiceLocator](https://javaee.github.io/hk2/apidocs//org/glassfish/hk2/api/ServiceLocator.html) which can
return the required injection. The following example shows how to utilize `ServiceLocatorClientProvider`:

```java
public static class MyRequestFilter implements ClientRequestFilter {

    // this injection does not work as filter is registered as an instance:
    // @Inject
    // private MyInjectedService service;
 
    @Override
    public void filter(ClientRequestContext requestContext) throws IOException {
        // use ServiceLocatorClientProvider to extract HK2 ServiceLocator from request
        final ServiceLocator locator = ServiceLocatorClientProvider.getServiceLocator(requestContext);
 
        // and ask for MyInjectedService:
        final MyInjectedService service = locator.getService(MyInjectedService.class);
 
        final String name = service.getName();
        ...
    }
}
```

For more information see javadoc of
[ServiceLocatorClientProvider](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/ServiceLocatorClientProvider.html)
(and javadoc of [ServiceLocatorProvider](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/ServiceLocatorProvider.html)
which supports common JAX-RS components).

## Securing a Client

This section describes how to setup SSL configuration on Jersey client (using JAX-RS API). The SSL configuration is
setup in `ClientBuilder`. The client builder contains methods for definition of
[KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.html), `TrustStore` or entire `SslContext`.
See the following example:

```java
SSLContext ssl = ... your configured SSL context;
Client client = ClientBuilder.newBuilder().sslContext(ssl).build();
Response response = client.target("https://example.com/resource").request().get();
```

The example above shows how to setup a custom `SslContext` to the `ClientBuilder`. Creating a `SslContext` can be more
difficult as you might need to init instance properly with the protocol, `KeyStore`, `TrustStore`, etc. Jersey offers a
utility [SslConfigurator](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/SslConfigurator.html)
class that can be used to setup the `SslContext`. The `SslConfigurator` can be configured based on standardized system
properties for SSL configuration, so for example you can configure the `KeyStore` file name using a environment variable
`javax.net.ssl.keyStore` and `SslConfigurator` will use such a variable to setup the `SslContext`. See
[javadoc of SslConfigurator](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/SslConfigurator.html)
for more details. The following code shows how a `SslConfigurator` can be used to create a custom SSL context.

```java
SslConfigurator sslConfig = SslConfigurator.newInstance()
        .trustStoreFile("./truststore_client")
        .trustStorePassword("secret-password-for-truststore")
        .keyStoreFile("./keystore_client")
        .keyPassword("secret-password-for-keystore");
 
SSLContext sslContext = sslConfig.createSSLContext();
Client client = ClientBuilder.newBuilder().sslContext(sslContext).build();
```

Note that you can also setup `KeyStore` and `TrustStore` directly on a `ClientBuilder` instance without wrapping them
into the `SslContext`. However, if you setup a `SslContext` it will override any previously defined `KeyStore` and
`TrustStore` settings. `ClientBuilder` also offers a method for defining a custom
[HostnameVerifier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html) implementation.
`HostnameVerifier` implementations are invoked when default host URL verification fails.

---
**Important**

A behaviour of [HostnameVerifier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html) is
dependent on an http client implementation. `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` and `ApacheConnectorProvider` work properly, that
means that after the unsuccessful URL verification `HostnameVerifier` is called and by means of it is possible to
revalidate URL using a custom implementation of `HostnameVerifier` and go on in a handskahe processing.
`JettyConnectorProvider` and `GrizzlyConnectorProvider` provide only host URL verification and throw a
`CertificateException` without any possibility to use custom `HostnameVerifier`. Moreover, in case of
`JettyConnectorProvider` there is a property `JettyClientProperties.ENABLE_SSL_HOSTNAME_VERIFICATION` to disable an
entire host URL verification mechanism in a handshake. 

Note that to utilize HTTP with SSL it is necessary to utilize the `"https"` scheme.

---

Currently the default connector provider `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` provides connectors based on `HttpUrlConnection`
which implement support for SSL defined by JAX-RS configuration discussed in this example. 

### Http Authentication Support

Jersey supports Basic and Digest HTTP Authentication.

---
**Important**

In version prior to Jersey 2.5 the support was provided by `org.glassfish.jersey.client.filter.HttpBasicAuthFilter` and
`org.glassfish.jersey.client.filter.HttpDigestAuthFilter`. Since Jersey 2.5 these filters are deprecated (and removed in
2.6) and both authentication methods are provided by single `Feature`
[HttpAuthenticationFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/authentication/HttpAuthenticationFeature.html). 

---

In order to enable http authentication support in Jersey client, register the
[HttpAuthenticationFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/authentication/HttpAuthenticationFeature.html).
This feature can provide both authentication methods, digest and basic. Feature can work in the following modes: 

* **BASIC**: Basic preemptive authentication. In preemptive mode the authentication information is always send with each
  HTTP request. This mode is more usual than the following non-preemptive mode (if you require BASIC authentication you
  will probably use this preemptive mode). This mode must be combined with usage of SSL/TLS as the password is send only
  BASE64 encoded. 
* **BASIC NON-PREEMPTIVE**: Basic non-preemptive authentication. In non-preemptive mode the authentication information
  is added only when server refuses the request with `401` status code and then the request is repeated with
  authentication information. This mode has negative impact on the performance. The advantage is that it does not send
  credentials when they are not needed. This mode must be combined with usage of SSL/TLS as the password is send only
  BASE64 encoded.
* **DIGEST**: Http digest authentication. Does not require usage of SSL/TLS.
* **UNIVERSAL**: Combination of basic and digest authentication. The feature works in non-preemptive mode which means
  that it sends requests without authentication information. If `401` status code is returned, the request is repeated
  and an appropriate authentication is used based on the authentication requested in the response (defined in
  `WWW-Authenticate`HTTP header). The feature remembers which authentication requests were successful for given URI and
  next time tries to preemptively authenticate against this URI with latest successful authentication method. 
  
To initialize the feature use static methods and builder of this feature. Example of building the feature in Basic
authentication mode is as follows:

```java
HttpAuthenticationFeature feature = HttpAuthenticationFeature.basic("user", "superSecretPassword");
```

Example of building the feature in basic non-preemptive mode:

```java
HttpAuthenticationFeature feature = HttpAuthenticationFeature
        .basicBuilder()
        .nonPreemptive()
        .credentials("user", "superSecretPassword")
        .build();
```

You could also build the feature without any default credentials:

```java
HttpAuthenticationFeature feature = HttpAuthenticationFeature.basicBuilder().build();
```

In this case you need to supply username and password for each request using request properties:

```java
Response response = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/rest/homer/contact")
        .request()
        .property(HTTP_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_USERNAME, "homer")
        .property(HTTP_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_PASSWORD, "p1swd745")
        .get();
```

This allows you to reuse the same client for authenticating with many different credentials.

See javadoc of the [HttpAuthenticationFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/authentication/HttpAuthenticationFeature.html)
for more details. 

## `InvocationInterceptor`

Suppose a case that the start of the request is to be logged and even measured. This can be done by
`ClientRequestFilter`, which is usually invoked before the request is wired on the network. However, the filter may be
called as a last of the filters in the chain. Sure, it can have the highest priority, but the other filters can have the
very same priority. Some long-running operations can be performed before the measuring can actually start. Even worse,
the filter may even be skipped from the chain by the previous `#abortWith`.

### `PreInvocationInterceptor`

For this, `PreInvocationInterceptor`, the code that executes before the `ClientRequestFilters` are invoked, has been
added to the client request chain. Jersey ensures all the interceptors are invoked with each request. The interceptor
contains a single `#beforeRequest` method, which corresponds to `ClientRequestFilter`:

```java
/**
 * The method invoked before the request starts.
 *
 * @param requestContext  The request context shared with ClientRequestFilter.
 */
void beforeRequest(ClientRequestContext requestContext);
``` 

Note that only a single `#abortWith` is allowed in all `PreInvocationInterceptor`s, otherwise an `IllegalStateException`
is thrown. All the exceptions accumulated in `PreInvocationInterceptor`s are thrown in a single `Exception`, available
through `#getSuppressed()`.

### `PostInvocationInterceptor`

Similarly, `ClientResponseFilter` seems to be a good place where the total time of the HTTP request can be measured, but
similarly to `ClientRequestFilter`, the response filter may not be invoked at all. For this, `PostInvocationInterceptor`
has been introduced. Jersey runtime ensures that every `PostInvocationInterceptor` is called. Since an exception can
occur during the HTTP request, `PostInvocationInterceptor` comes with two methods:

```java
/**
 * The method is invoked after a request when no exception is thrown, or the Throwables are resolved by previous
 * PostInvocationInterceptor.
 *
 * @param requestContext  The request context
 * @param responseContext  The response context of the original Response or response context defined by the new
 * resolving Response.
 */
void afterRequest(ClientRequestContext requestContext, ClientResponseContext responseContext);
 
/**
 * The method is invoked after a Throwable is caught during the client request chain processing.
 *
 * @param requestContext  The request context.
 * @param exceptionContext  The context available to handle the caught Throwables.
 */
void onException(ClientRequestContext requestContext, ExceptionContext exceptionContext);
```

The `#afterRequest` method is executed when no exception has been thrown during the HTTP request, `#onException` method
is executed if the exception has been thrown during the request. It is possible to set a response in `#onException`, and
the consecutive `PostInvocationInterceptor` will execute its `#afterRequest` method. The measuring example can looks as
follows, then:

```java
String response = ClientBuilder
        .newClient()
        .target("path")
        .register(new PreInvocationInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public void beforeRequest(ClientRequestContext requestContext) {
                startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            }
        })
        .register(new PostInvocationInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public void afterRequest(ClientRequestContext requestContext, ClientResponseContext responseContext) {
                logDuration(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime);
            }
            @Override
            public void onException(ClientRequestContext requestContext, ExceptionContext exceptionContext) {
                logDuration(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime);
            }
        })
        .request()
        .get()
        .readEntity(String.class);
```
