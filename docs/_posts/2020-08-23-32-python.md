The purpose of this guide is to help any **experienced Java developers** with situations like this: you are writing a
Python project (You love Java, but for some reason you end up being in a situation where you have to put it in Python)
This guide covers you using a comparative strategy: we teach you Python by linking Java with Python's equivalent. You
know Maven and we tell you what is the "Maven" equivalent in Python; You know Python doesn't play with `Class` in the
same way how Java does and we teach you that.

This guide assumes you know all the basics of Python; you know what a Python `dict` is and you know there is something
called Python shell that executes Python script in your terminal, etc.

## Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X

Mac OS X comes with Python 2.7 out of the box. The version of Python that ships with OS X is great for learning, but
it's not good for development. The version shipped with OS X may be out of date from the
[official current Python release](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), which is considered the stable production
version.

Before installing Python, you’ll need to install GCC. GCC can be obtained by downloading
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

> 📔 If you perform a fresh install of Xcode, you will also need to add the commandline tools by running
> `xcode-select --install` on the terminal.

While OS X comes with a large number of Unix utilities, those familiar with Linux systems will notice one key component
missing: a package manager. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) fills this void.

To [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/#install), open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Now, we can install Python 3:

```bash
$ brew install python
```

### Use pyenv to Run Multiple Versions of Python on a Mac

Managing a local Python development environment continues to be a challenge, even for experienced developers. While
there are well-documented
[strategies for package management](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/managing-python-packages), there is another step
necessary to ensure you are running the version of Python you need when you need it.

#### Why does the Version of Python Matter?

For many years, Python 2 was the commonly used major version of the programming language. In January 2020,
[Python 2 reached end of life](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/end-of-life-python-2), and only Python 3 will be
supported by the language's core maintainers from then forward. Python 3 is developing steadily, and releasing new
updates regularly. That makes it important for me to regularly get those updates.

Recently, I tried to run a project on macOS that depended on Python 3.5.9, a version that I did not have installed on my
system. It might seem logical to think the Python package manager pip could install it*, but that wasn't the case:

```bash
$ pip install python3.5.9
Collecting python3.5.9
  ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python3.5.9 (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for python3.5.9
```

Alternatively, I could have downloaded that version from the official Python website, but how would I run it in on my
Mac alongside my existing version of Python? Specifying the version of Python I intend to use every time I run the
interpreter (python3.7 or python3.5 for example) seems error-prone at best. There has to be a better way.

#### Installing and Setting up pyenv

Thankfully, pyenv exists to work around this series of complexities. To start, I needed to install pyenv. I could
[clone and compile it myself from source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), but I prefer to manage packages like this
through the Homebrew package manager:

```bash
$ brew install pyenv
```

In order to use the version of Python through pyenv, it's essential to understand the shell's `PATH` variable. `PATH`
determines where the shell searches for files by the name of the command. You must ensure the shell will find the
version of Python run by pyenv, not the one installed by default (which is often called the system version). If you
don't change the path, here is the result:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```

That's the system version of Python. To set up pyenv correctly, you can run the following in Bash or zsh:

```bash
$ PATH=$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH
```

Now, if you check the version of Python, you'll see it is the one managed by pyenv:

```bash
$ which python
/Users/my_username/.pyenv/shims/python
```

Now we could switch version

    pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.[678]"
    pyenv install -v 3.7.2 
    pyenv global 3.7.2
    python -V

#### Configure PyCharm/IntellIj with pyenv

We will first need to know the path of the Python we just switched to using pyenv:

```bash
$ which python
.../.pyenv/shims/python
```

Then, we will add `.../.pyenv/shims/python` to the Python interpretor config:

![Error pycharm-configure-pyenv-interpretor.png]({{ "/assets/img/pycharm-configure-pyenv-interpretor.png" | relative_url}})

### Pipenv

This section walks you through installing and using Python packages.

It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong recommendations on best practices. Keep in
mind that Python is used for a great many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies may
change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance presented here is most directly applicable to the
development and deployment of network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to managing
development and testing environments for any kind of project.

> 📔 This section is written for Python 3, however, these instructions should work fine on Python 2.7 - if you are still
> using it, for some reason.

#### Make Sure You've Got Python & pip

Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and is available from your command line. You can check this by
simply running:

```bash
$ python --version
```

You should get some output like `3.6.2`. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from
[python.org](https://python.org/) or refer to the
[Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)

> 📔 If you get an error like this:
> 
> ```bash
> >>> python
> Traceback (most recent call last):
> File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> NameError: name 'python' is not defined
> ```
> 
> It is because this command is intended to be run in a shell (also called a terminal or console). See the Python for
> Beginners
> [getting started tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly)
> for an introduction to using your operating system’s shell and interacting with Python.

Additionally, you'll need to make sure you have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) available. You can check this by
running:

```bash
$ pip --version
```

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from [python.org](https://python.org/), or via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you should already have pip. If you’re on Linux and installed using your OS package
manager, you may have to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) separately.

#### Installing Pipenv

Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you're familiar with Node.js' [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or
Ruby's [bundler](http://bundler.io/), it is similar in spirit to those tools. While [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as it is a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management
for common use cases. To install Pipenv:

```bash
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

#### Installing Packages for Your Project

**Pipenv manages dependencies on a per-project basis**. To install packages, change into your project's directory (or
just an empty directory) and run:

```bash
$ cd project_folder
$ pipenv install requests
```

Pipenv will install the excellent [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library and create a Pipfile
for you in your project's directory. The Pipfile is used to track which dependencies your project needs in case you need
to re-install them, such as when you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this (although the
exact paths shown will vary):

```

Adding requests to Pipfile's [packages]...
P.S. You have excellent taste! ✨ 🍰 ✨
```

#### Using Installed Packages

Now that Requests is installed you can create a simple `main.py` file to use it:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')

print('Your IP is {0}'.format(response.json()['origin']))
```

Then you can run this script using `pipenv run`:

```bash
$ pipenv run python main.py
```

You should get output similar to this:

```
Your IP is 8.8.8.8
```

Using $ pipenv run ensures that your installed packages are available to your script. It is also possible to spawn a new
shell that ensures all commands have access to your installed packages with `$ pipenv shell`.

### virtualenv

[virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates
a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need. It can be
used standalone, in place of Pipenv.

Install virtualenv via pip:

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Test your installation:

```bash
$ virtualenv --version
```

#### Basic Usage

Create a virtual environment for a project:

```bash
$ cd project_folder
$ virtualenv venv
```

`virtualenv venv` will create a folder in the current directory which will contain the Python executable files, and a
copy of the pip library which you can use to install other packages. The name of the virtual environment (in this case,
it was "venv") can be anything; omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.

> 📔 "venv" is the general convention used globally. As it is readily available in ignore files (e.g. .gitignore)

You can also use the Python interpreter of your choice (like python2.7).

```bash
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
```

or change the interpreter globally with an env variable in `~/.bashrc`:

```
$ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7
```

To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt (e.g.
`(venv)Your-Computer:project_folder UserName$`) to let you know that it's active. From now on, any package that you
install using pip will be placed in the venv folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it:

```bash
$ deactivate
```

This puts you back to the system’s default Python interpreter with all its installed libraries.

To delete a virtual environment, just delete its folder. (In this case, it would be `rm -rf venv`.)

> 📔️ Python has included venv module from version 3.3. For more details:
> [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

#### Environment Separation

Running `virtualenv` with the option `--no-site-packages` will not include the packages that are installed globally.
This can be useful for keeping the package list clean in case it needs to be accessed later. (This is the default
behavior for `virtualenv` 1.7 and later.)

#### Environment Management

In order to keep your environment consistent, it's a good idea to "freeze" the current state of the environment
packages. To do this, run:

```bash
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will create a `requirements.txt` file, which contains a simple list of all the packages in the current environment,
and their respective versions. You can see the list of installed packages without the requirements format using
`pip list`. Later it will be easier for a different developer (or you, if you need to re-create the environment) to
install the same packages using the same versions:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This can help ensure consistency across installations, across deployments, and across developers.

Lastly, remember to exclude the virtual environment folder from source control by adding it to the ignore list

##### virtualenvwrapper

[`virtualenvwrapper`](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides a set of commands which
makes working with virtual environments much more pleasant. It also places all your virtual environments in one place.

To install (make sure **virtualenv** is already installed):

```bash
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper
$ export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
$ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

###### Basic Usage

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv project_folder
```

This creates the `project_folder` folder inside `~/Envs`.

Work on a virtual environment:

```bash
$ workon project_folder
```

`workon` also deactivates whatever environment you are currently in, so you can quickly switch between environments.

Alternatively, you can make a project, which creates the virtual environment, and also a project directory inside
`$WORKON_HOME`, which is `cd`-ed into when you workon `project_folder`.

```bash
$ mkproject project_folder
```

**virtualenvwrapper** provides tab-completion on environment names. It really helps when you have a lot of environments
and have trouble remembering their names.

Deactivating is still the same:

```bash
$ deactivate
```

To delete:

```bash
$ rmvirtualenv venv
```

##### direnv

When you `cd` into a directory containing a `.env`, [direnv](https://direnv.net/) automagically activates the
environment.

Install it on Mac OS X using brew:

```bash
$ brew install direnv
```

On Linux follow the instructions at [direnv.net](https://direnv.net/)

## Python Standards

If you know JVM Specificaiton or Java Language Specification, you might want to know the "equivalents" of them in
Python, this is the place you go - [PEP's](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)

Must-read PEPs:

- [how to document Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [code style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants)
- [variable annotation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/)
- [Type Hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)

## How to create a Python "maven" package

You know all the details about maven. Now you wonder what if I would like to make a Python package? This is where you
start - https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html (If the link is not working, checkout the doc
source code at https://github.com/QubitPi/python-packaging)

### setuptools

- **access resource files** (remember the Maven `resource` directory?):
  https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html

### package and class

Python treats `Class` differently. They call it `module` and a `module` could contain multiple `classes`. Collect some
related class to one module(source file), and collect some related module to one package

### Checkstyle

[Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) is the Python's equivalent of
[checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/index.html). People know that to make checkstyle useful in Maven, they
use [maven-checkstyle-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/index.html). For setuptools in
Python, it is [setuptools-lint](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-lint/) and [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

#### PyLint FAQ

##### Overriding max-line-length in Individual File

    pylint --max-line-length=240

##### How to Fix "c0209: formatting a regular string which could be a f-string (consider-using-f-string)"

Let's consider this small script:

```python
name = 'world'

a = 'my hello %s' % name

print(a)

b = 'again this name is {}'.format(name) 

print(b)
```

If we run Pylint 2.11.0+ on it, we get a few errors:

![Error loading pylint-f-string-check.png]({{ "/assets/img/pylint-f-string-check.png" | relative_url}})

If it's OK for you to update to f-string, then that's the recommended way. How you do that depends on how you're
formatting your strings but in doubt you can
[check this article](https://miguendes.me/73-examples-to-help-you-master-pythons-f-strings) to learn the myriad ways you
can use a f-string.

In my case, replacing `%` and `str.format` becomes:

```python
name = 'world'

a = f'my hello {name}'

print(a)

b = f'again this name is {name}'

print(b)
```

If we re-run Pylint, we get:

![Error loading pylint-f-string-check-passed.png]({{ "/assets/img/pylint-f-string-check-passed.png" | relative_url}})

### Documentation

#### Language

You will find multiples for writing Python docs, I recommend
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) which is the supported language by the popular
Python documentation generator [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Note that the
[official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is generated by Sphinx.

#### Documentation Generator

Documentation is generated using [maven site](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/). 

Unlike maven which makes it hard to change the style/look of the generated site, you get little bit of freedom on the
style of the site for Python using [Sphinx Theming](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/theming.html)

##### Example

Suppose we have a python progject with the following directory structure

    project-foo
      └── module-x

where module-x bundles several `.py` source files.

To generate doc for module-x module, switch to the project-foo directory and run

    sphinx-quickstart docs

This will generate `docs` directory under the project-foo directory, which makes it look like the following

    project-foo
      └── module-x
      └── docs

Now modify the `docs/source/conf.py`: 

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../module-x/'))

extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc'
]

html_theme = 'classic'
```

Next, generate the package .rst file for module-x:

    sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source module-x/

Lastly, generte the HTML, which will be put into the "docs/build/html" directory as specified in the following command:

    sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html

### Persistence

#### SQLAlchemy

##### Establishing Connectivity - the Engine

The start of any SQLAlchemy application is an object called the **Engine**. This object acts as a central source of
connections to a particular database, providing both a factory as well as a holding space called a connection pool for
these database connections. **The engine is typically a global object created just once for a particular database
server**, and is configured using a URL string which will describe how it should connect to the database host or
backend.

We will use an local MySQL database. The Engine is created by using `create_engine()`, specifying the
`create_engine.future` flag set to `True` so that we make full use of
[2.0 style](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/glossary.html#term-2.0-style) usage:

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
>>> engine = create_engine("mysql://$db_user:$password@$db_ip:$db_port/$db", echo=True, future=True)
```

where

* **`$db_user`** the user for jumping into the database, such as `root`
* **`$password`** the password for the `$db_user`
* **`$db_ip`** the host with the MySQL installed; in this case it is going to be `localhost`
* **`$db_port`** MySQL port number, i.e. 3306 for example
* **`$db`** The database name within this MySQL instance being connected to

The Engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application. It's "home base" for the actual database and its
[DBAPI](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/glossary.html#term-DBAPI), delivered to the SQLAlchemy application through a
connection **pool** and a **Dialect**, which describes how to talk to a specific kind of database/DBAPI combination.

An Engine references both a Dialect and a Pool, which together interpret the DBAPI's module functions as well as the
behavior of the database.

Creating an engine, as wee have seen above, is just a matter of issuing a single call, `create_engine()`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/mydatabase')
```

The above engine creates a Dialect object tailored towards PostgreSQL, as well as a Pool object which will establish a
DBAPI connection at localhost:5432 when a connection request is first received. Note that the Engine and its underlying
Pool do not establish the first actual DBAPI connection until the
[`Engine.connect()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine.connect) method is
called, or an operation which is dependent on this method such as
[`Engine.execute()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine.execute) is
invoked. In this way, Engine and Pool can be said to have a **lazy initialization** behavior.

The Engine, once created, can either be used directly to interact with the database, or can be passed to a Session
object to work with the ORM.

##### Working with Transactions and the DBAPI

```python
# "commit as you go"
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     conn.execute(text("CREATE TABLE some_table (x int, y int)"))
...     conn.execute(
...         text("INSERT INTO some_table (x, y) VALUES (:x, :y)"),
...         [{"x": 1, "y": 1}, {"x": 2, "y": 4}]
...     )
...     conn.commit()
```

##### Automap

Define an extension to the
[`sqlalchemy.ext.declarative`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/declarative/api.html#module-sqlalchemy.ext.declarative)
system which automatically generates mapped classes and relationships from a database schema, typically though not
necessarily one which is reflected.

###### Basic Usage

The simplest usage is to reflect an existing database into a new model. We create a new
[AutomapBase](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/automap.html#sqlalchemy.ext.automap.AutomapBase) class in
a similar manner as to how we create a declarative base class, using
[automap_base()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/automap.html#sqlalchemy.ext.automap.automap_base). We
then call
[AutomapBase.prepare()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/automap.html#sqlalchemy.ext.automap.AutomapBase.prepare)
on the resulting base class, asking it to reflect the schema and produce mappings:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

Base = automap_base()

# engine, suppose it has two tables 'user' and 'address' set up
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///mydatabase.db")

# reflect the tables
Base.prepare(engine, reflect=True)

# mapped classes are now created with names by default
# matching that of the table name.
User = Base.classes.user
Address = Base.classes.address

session = Session(engine)

# rudimentary relationships are produced
session.add(Address(email_address="foo@bar.com", user=User(name="foo")))
session.commit()

# collection-based relationships are by default named
# "<classname>_collection"
print (u1.address_collection)
```

###### Performance Issue

The auto mapping is a very expensive process because it essentially loads all persistence entities from a database. An
enterprise application should cache the auto mapping:

```python
Base = None

def init_persistence_context(engine):
    global Base
    if not Base:
        Base = automap_base()
        Base.prepare(engine, reflect=True)

    return Base
```

## Some useful caveates to know

When you send POST request, you should read this first:
https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests
Chances are you will not notice that the JSON payload is not a string. It's actually a ``dict`` object. Passing a string
object to POST method might gives you a 2 hours of painful debugging session(at least that was the case for me).

## Syntax for Java Developers

### Global Variables

To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the `global` keyword:

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

### How do I Get Time of a Python Script's Execution?

The simplest way in Python:

```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
main()
print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
```

This assumes that your program takes at least a tenth of second to run.

Prints:

    --- 0.764891862869 seconds ---

### Python Logging

https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/logging.html

### `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python

#### `*args`

The special syntax `*args` in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a
function. It is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list.

- The syntax is to use the symbol `*` to take in a variable number of arguments; by convention, it is often used with
  the word args.
- What `*args` allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously
  defined. With `*args`, any number of extra arguments can be used on to your current formal parameters (including
  zero extra arguments).
- Using the `*`, the variable that we associate with the `*` becomes an iterable meaning you can do things like
  iterate over it, run some higher order functions such as map and filter, etc.

```python
def myFun(arg1, *argv):
    print ("First argument :", arg1)
    for arg in argv:
        print("Next argument through *argv :", arg)

myFun("A", "B", "C", "D")
```

Output:

    First argument : A
    Next argument through *argv : B
    Next argument through *argv : C
    Next argument through *argv : D

#### `**kwargs`

The special syntax `**kwargs` in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument
list. We use the name `kwargs` with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through
keyword arguments (and any number of them).

- A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
- One can think of the `kwargs` as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it.
That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesn't seem to be any order in which they were printed out.

```python
def myFun(arg1, **kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print ("%s == %s" %(key, value))

myFun("Foo", first ='Bar', mid ='Bat', last='Baz')
```

Output:

    last == Bar
    mid == Bat
    first == Baz

### Make function return multiple return values

You can use a `typing.Tuple` type hint (to specify the type of the content of the tuple, if it is not necessary, the
built-in class `tuple` can be used instead):

```python
from typing import Tuple

def greeting(name: str) -> Tuple[str, List[float], int]:
    # do something
    return a, b, c
```

### UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)

You need to read the Python [Unicode HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/unicode.html). This error is the very
first example.  Basically, stop using str to convert from unicode to encoded text / bytes.

Instead, properly use `.encode()` to encode the string:

```python
str(foo).encode('utf-8')
```

### `SyntaxError- EOL while scanning string literal`


An EOL ( End of Line ) error indicates that the Python interpreter expected a particular character or set of characters
to have occurred in a specific line of code, but that character is not found before the end of the line . This results
in stopping the program execution and throwing a syntax error.

The `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal` error when:

1. A closing quote is missing, for example

    ```python
    def printMsg():
        return "This is a test
    printMsg()
    ```
    
    output:
    
    ```
    return "This is a test
                         ^
    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
    ```
        
2. A string spans multiple lines, for example

    ```python
    def printMsg():
        str = "This is
          a test"
        print(str)
    printMsg()
    ```

The solution to the 2nd case is to use triple quotes:

```python
def printMsg():
    str = """This is
      a test"""
    print(str)
printMsg()
```
