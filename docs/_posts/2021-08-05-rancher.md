## Overview

Rancher is a container management platform built for organizations that deploy containers in production.

Rancher users have the choice of creating Kubernetes clusters with Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) or cloud Kubernetes
services, such as GKE, AKS, and EKS.

### Meet IT Requirements

Rancher supports centralized authentication, access control, and monitoring for all Kubernetes clusters under its
control. For example, you can:

* Use your Active Directory credentials to access Kubernetes clusters hosted by cloud vendors, such as GKE.
* Setup and enforce access control and security policies across all users, groups, projects, clusters, and clouds.
* View the health and capacity of your Kubernetes clusters from a single-pane-of-glass.

### Empower DevOps Teams

Rancher provides an intuitive user interface for DevOps engineers to manage their application workload. Rancher is
certified with a wide selection of cloud native ecosystem products, including, for example, security tools, monitoring
systems, container registries, and storage and networking drivers.

The following figure illustrates the role Rancher plays in IT and DevOps organizations. _Each team deploys their
applications on the public or private clouds they choose. IT administrators gain visibility and enforce policies across
all users, clusters, and clouds.

### Rancher API Server

The Rancher API server is built on top of an embedded Kubernetes API server and an [etcd database](https://etcd.io/). It
implements the following functionalities:

#### Authorization and Role-Based Access Control

* **User management**: The Rancher API server
  [manages user identities](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/authentication/) that correspond to
  external authentication providers like Active Directory or GitHub, in addition to local users.
* **Authorization**: The Rancher API server manages
  [access control](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/) and
  [security](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/pod-security-policies/) policies.
  
#### Working with Kubernetes

* **Provisioning Kubernetes clusters**: The Rancher API server can
  [provision Kubernetes](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/) on existing nodes, or perform
  [Kubernetes upgrades](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-admin/upgrading-kubernetes).
* **Catalog management**: Rancher provides the ability to use a
  [catalog of Helm charts](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/catalog/) that make it easy to repeatedly deploy
  applications.
* **Managing projects**: **A project is a group of multiple namespaces and access control policies within a cluster**. A
  project is a Rancher concept, not a Kubernetes concept, which allows you to manage multiple namespaces as a group and
  perform Kubernetes operations in them. The Rancher UI provides features for
  [project administration](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/project-admin/) and
  [for managing applications within projects](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/k8s-in-rancher/).
* **Pipelines**: Setting up a [pipeline](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/project-admin/pipelines/) can help
  developers deliver new software as quickly and efficiently as possible. Within Rancher, you can configure pipelines
  for each of your Rancher projects.
* **Istio**: Our integration with Istio is designed so that a Rancher operator, such as an administrator or cluster
  owner, can deliver Istio to developers. Then developers can use Istio to enforce security policies, troubleshoot
  problems, or manage traffic for green/blue deployments, canary deployments, or A/B testing.

#### Working with Cloud Infrastructure

* **Tracking nodes**: The Rancher API server tracks identities of all the nodes in all clusters.
* **Setting up infrastructure**: When configured to use a cloud provider, Rancher can dynamically provision new nodes
  and persistent storage in the cloud.

#### Cluster Visibility

* **Logging**: Rancher can integrate with a variety of popular logging services and tools that exist outside of your
  Kubernetes clusters.
* **Monitoring**: Using Rancher, you can monitor the state and processes of your cluster nodes, Kubernetes components,
  and software deployments through integration with Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution.
* **Alerting**: To keep your clusters and applications healthy and driving your organizational productivity forward, you
  need to stay informed of events occurring in your clusters and projects, both planned and unplanned.

## Architecture

The figure depicts a Rancher Server installation that manages two downstream Kubernetes clusters: one created by
[RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/) and  another created by
[Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/).

### Communicating with Downstream User Clusters

The below diagram shows how the cluster controllers, cluster agents, and node agents allow Rancher to control downstream
clusters.

![rancher-architecture-cluster-controller.svg not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/rancher-architecture-cluster-controller.svg" | relative_url}})

#### The Authentication Proxy

In this diagram, a user named Bob wants to see all pods running on a downstream user cluster called User Cluster 1.
From within Rancher, he can run a `kubectl` command to see the pods. Bob is authenticated through Rancher's
authentication proxy.

The authentication proxy forwards all Kubernetes API calls to downstream clusters. It integrates with authentication
services like local authentication, Active Directory, and GitHub. On every Kubernetes API call, the authentication proxy
authenticates the caller and sets the proper Kubernetes impersonation headers before forwarding the call to Kubernetes
masters.

Rancher communicates with Kubernetes clusters using a
[service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/), which provides
an identity for processes that run in a pod.

#### Cluster Controllers and Cluster Agent

Each downstream user cluster has a cluster agent, which opens a tunnel to the corresponding cluster controller within
the Rancher server.

There is one cluster controller and one cluster agent for each downstream cluster. Each cluster controller:

* Watches for resource changes in the downstream cluster
* Brings the current state of the downstream cluster to the desired state
* Configures access control policies to clusters and projects
* Provisions clusters by calling the required Docker machine drivers and Kubernetes engines, such as RKE and GKE

By default, to enable Rancher to communicate with a downstream cluster, the cluster controller connects to the cluster
agent. If the cluster agent is not available, the cluster controller can connect to a [node agent](#node-agents)
instead.

#### Node Agents

If the cluster agent (also called `cattle-cluster-agent`) is not available, one of the node agents creates a tunnel to
the cluster controller to communicate with Rancher.

The `cattle-node-agent` is deployed using a
[DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) resource to make sure it runs on every
node in a Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster. It is used to interact with the nodes when performing cluster operations.
Examples of cluster operations include upgrading the Kubernetes version and creating or restoring etcd snapshots.

#### Authorized Cluster Endpoint

An authorized cluster endpoint allows users to connect to the Kubernetes API server of a downstream cluster without
having to route their requests through the Rancher authentication proxy.

> The authorized cluster endpoint only works on Rancher-launched Kubernetes clusters. In other words, it only works in
> clusters where Rancher [used RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters) to
> provision the cluster. It is not available for registered clusters, or for clusters in a hosted Kubernetes provider,
> such as Amazon EKS.

There are two main reasons why a user might need the authorized cluster endpoint:

1. To access a downstream user cluster while Rancher is down
2. To reduce latency in situations where the Rancher server and downstream cluster are separated by a long distance

## Catalog

Rancher provides a catalog of application templates that make it easy to deploy these complex stacks. By accessing the
**Catalog tab**, you can view all the templates that are available in the enabled catalogs. The **Library** catalog
contains templates from the [Rancher certified catalog](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-catalog) and the
**Community** catalog contains templates from the [community-catalog](https://github.com/rancher/community-catalog).
Rancher will only be maintaining support for the _certified_ templates in the library.
