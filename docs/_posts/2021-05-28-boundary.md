Software architecture is the art of drawing lines that I call boundaries. Those boundaries separate software elements
from one another, and restrict those on one side from knowing about those on the other. Some of those lines are drawn
very early in a project's life—even before any code is written. Others are drawn much later. Those that are drawn early
are drawn for the purposes of deferring decisions for as long as possible, and of keeping those decisions from polluting
the core business logic.

_**The goal of an architect is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system**_.
What it is that saps this kind of people-power? Coupling—and especially coupling to premature decisions.

## White Lines Do You Draw and When Do You Draw Them?

**You draw lines between things that matter and things that don't**. The GUI doesn't matter to the business rules, so
there should be a line between them. The database doesn't matter to the GUI, so there should be a line between them. The
database doesn't matter to the business rules, so there should be a line between them.

Here is an example:

![boundary-eg.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg.png" | relative_url}})

The "BusinessRules" use the "DatabaseInterface" to load and save data. The "DatabaseAccess" implements the interface and
directs the operation of the actual "Database".

The classes and interfaces in this diagram are symbolic. In a real application, there would be many business rule
classes, many database interface classes, and many database access implementations. All of them, though, would follow
roughly the same pattern.

Where is the boundary line? The boundary is drawn across the inheritance relationship, just below the
"DatabaseInterface"

![boundary-eg-2.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg-2.png" | relative_url}})

Note the two arrows leaving the "DatabaseAccess" class. Those two arrows point away from the "DatabaseAccess" class.
That means that none of these classes knows that the "DatabaseAccess" class exists.

Now let's pull back a bit. We'll look at the component that contains many business rules, and the component that
contains the database and all its access classes

![boundary-eg-3.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg-3.png" | relative_url}})

Note the direction of the arrow. The "Database" knows about the "BusinessRules". The "BusinessRules", however, do not
know about the "Database". This implies that the "DatabaseInterface" classes live in the "BusinessRules" component,
while the "DatabaseAccess" classes live in the "Database" component.

The direction of this line is important. It shows that the "Database" does not matter to the "BusinessRules", but the
"Database" cannot exist without the "BusinessRules".

The direction of this line is important. It shows that the "Database" does not matter to the "BusinessRules", but the
"Database" cannot exist without the "BusinessRules".

Having drawn this boundary line between the two components, and having set the direction of the arrow toward the
"BusinessRules", we can now see that the "BusinessRules" could use any kind of database. The "Database" component could
be replaced with many different implementations - the "BusinessRules" don't care. That means that the **database
decision can be deferred and you can focus on getting the business rules written and tested before you have to make the
database decision**

### Input & Output

We often think about the behavior of the system in terms of the behavior of the IO. Consider a video game, for example.
Your experience is dominated by the interface: the screen, the mouse, the buttons, and the sounds. You forget that
behind that interface there is a model - a sophisticated set of data structures and functions - driving it. More
importantly, that model does not need the interface. It would happily execute its duties, modeling all the events in the
game, without the game ever being displayed on the screen. **The interface does not matter to the model - the business
rules**.

![boundary-eg-4.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg-4.png" | relative_url}})

## Plugin Architecture

Taken together, these two decisions about the database and the GUI create a kind of pattern for the addition of other
components. That pattern is the same pattern that is used by systems that allow third-party plugins.

Indeed, the history of software development technology is the story of how to conveniently create plugins to establish a
scalable and maintainable system architecture. The core business rules are kept separate from, and independent of, those
components that are either optional or that can be implemented in many different forms:

![boundary-eg-5.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg-5.png" | relative_url}})

Because the user interface in this design is considered to be a plugin, we have made it possible to plug in many
different kinds of user interfaces. They could be web based, client/server based, SOA based, Console based, or based on
any other kind of user interface technology.

> If the GUI plugs in to the business rules, then changes in the GUI cannot affect those business rules. it is one that
> we desire to have in our own systems. We want certain modules to be immune to others. For example, we don't want the
> business rules to break when someone changes the schema of the database

**Boundaries are drawn where there is an axis of change. The components on one side of the boundary change at different
rates, and for different reasons, than the components on the other side of the boundary** (Single Responsibility
Principle).
