## Logging Traffic

Jersey Logging supports the logging request and response via internal client and server filters, which are configured
and registered by
***[LoggingFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html)***'s
properties. `LoggingFeature` has been introduced in Jersey 2.23 version and deprecates an older `LoggingFilter`.

`LoggingFeature` might be discovered by
[auto-discoverable mechanism](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/07/26/4-application-deployment-and-runtime-environments.html#auto-discoverable-features)
or initialized by registering on client or server components. Client or server logging filter is initialized depending
on which context is `LoggingFeature` registered with. 

### Configuration and Registering

#### Configuration Options

* ***Logger name*** - Defines a logger used to log request and response messages. Default value is
  [LoggingFeature.DEFAULT_LOGGER_NAME](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html#DEFAULT_LOGGER_NAME).
* ***Logger level*** - Defines level that will be used to log messages by logging filters. Messages will be logged only
  if the effective level of the logger allows it. Default value is
  [LoggingFeature.DEFAULT_LOGGER_LEVEL](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html#DEFAULT_LOGGER_LEVEL).
* ***Verbosity*** - Verbosity determines how detailed message will be logged. See
  [LoggingFeature.Verbosity](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.Verbosity.html)
  javadoc.
  * The lowest verbosity
    [LoggingFeature.Verbosity.HEADERS_ONLY](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.Verbosity.html#HEADERS_ONLY)
    will log only request/response headers.
  * The medium verbosity
    ([LoggingFeature.Verbosity.PAYLOAD_TEXT](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.Verbosity.html#PAYLOAD_TEXT))
    will log request/response headers, as well as an entity if considered a readable text. The entity is considered a
    readable text, if
    [MediaType](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jaxrs-api/apidocs/2.1.6/javax/ws/rs/core/MediaType.html) is text/* or is
    one of
    * `application/atom+xml`
    * `application/json`
    * `application/svg+xml`
    * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    * `application/xhtml+xml`
    * `application/xml`
  * The highest verbosity
    [LoggingFeature.Verbosity.PAYLOAD_ANY](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.Verbosity.html#PAYLOAD_ANY)
    will log all types of an entity (besides the request/response headers). 
  
  Note that the entity is logged up to the specified maximum number of bytes (see
  [LoggingFeature.LOGGING_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html#LOGGING_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE)).
  Default value is
  [LoggingFeature.DEFAULT_VERBOSITY](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html#DEFAULT_VERBOSITY).
* ***Maximum entity size*** - Maximum number of entity bytes to be logged (and buffered) - if the entity is larger,
  logging filter will print (and buffer in memory) only the specified number of bytes and print "...more..." string at
  the end. Negative values are interpreted as zero. Default value
  [LoggingFeature.DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html#DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE).

#### Configuration Properties

The feature is enabled on when auto-discoverable mechanism is not disabled and at least one of the feature's property is
set. For enabling client or server logging filter one of the
[common properties](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/CommonProperties.html)
or `_CLIENT` suffixed
[properties](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/client/ClientProperties.html),
or
[_SERVER](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/appendix-properties.html#appendix-properties-server)
properties respectively.

An example of initializing server-side logging with the highest verbosity:

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.property(LoggingFeature.LOGGING_FEATURE_VERBOSITY_CLIENT, LoggingFeature.Verbosity.PAYLOAD_ANY);
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient(clientConfig);
```

The `LoggingFeature` might be registered explicitly on
[ResourceConfig](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/server/ResourceConfig.html)
for server-side logging or on
[Client](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jaxrs-api/apidocs/2.1.6/javax/ws/rs/client/Client.html) for client-side logging.

```java
ResourceConfig config = new ResourceConfig(HelloWorldResource.class);
config.register(new LoggingFeature(LOGGER, LoggingFeature.Verbosity.PAYLOAD_ANY));
```

Following examples demonstrate registering LoggingFeature on server-side with default values and values defined by one
of the public constructors (see
[LoggingFeature](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/apidocs/snapshot/jersey/org/glassfish/jersey/logging/LoggingFeature.html)).

```java
ResourceConfig config = new ResourceConfig(HelloWorldResource.class);
config.register(LoggingFeature.class);
```

An example of server-side logging with entity `Hello World!`
