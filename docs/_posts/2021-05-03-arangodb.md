## Multi-Model

ArangoDB is a native **multi-model database**, which provides the capabilities of a graph database, a document database,
a key-value store in one C++ core. ArangoDB is **native**, because users can use and freely combine all supported data
models even in a single query. **With ArangoDB, users can easily change their data access strategy by just changing a
query.**

## Install ArangoDB

### Local (Mac)

ArangoDB can be installed using the standard `.dmg` package which is available at
https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/macosx/.

When ArangoDB is installed and opened, a terminal pops up with the following, which means ArangoDB has been installed
successfully:

```bash
ArangoDB server has been started

The database directory is located at
   '/Users/.../Library/ArangoDB/opt/arangodb/var/lib/arangodb3'

The log file is located at
   '/Users/.../Library/ArangoDB/opt/arangodb/var/log/arangodb3/arangod.log'

You can access the server using a browser at 'http://127.0.0.1:8529/'
or start the ArangoDB shell
   '/Applications/ArangoDB3-CLI.app/Contents/Resources/arangosh'

Switching to log-file now, closing this window will NOT stop the server.


2021-05-28T02:49:20Z [51931] INFO [cf3f4] ArangoDB (version 3.7.11 [darwin]) is ready for business. Have fun!
```

Let's start ArangoDB with its [UI](#web-interface)

#### Web Interface

![Error loading arango-ui-login.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui-login.png" | relative_url}})

By default, authentication is enabled. The default user is `root`. Depending on the installation method used, the
installation process either prompted for the root password or the **default root password is empty**.

Next you will be asked which database to use. Every server instance comes with a `_system` database. Select this
database to continue:

![Error loading arango-login-select-db.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-login-select-db.png" | relative_url}})

You should then be presented the dashboard with server statistics like this:

![Error loading arango-ui.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-ui.png" | relative_url}})

**ArangoDB is a very nice choice for business prototyping**, because we could experiment graph data and explore
potential business application on the web interface using it's rich features. It also comes with a set of example
graphs for your to explore as shown in the figure below

## Concepts

### Database Interaction

ArangoDB is a database that serves JSON documents. The [web interface](#web-interface) we just saw is called
**Aardvark**. There is also an interactive shell, called **Arangosh**, for developers. In addition, there are
[drivers](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/drivers/index.html) that provides programmatic access to different
languages, such as Java.

### Data model

### Document

The documents you can store in ArangoDB closely follow the JSON format, although they are **stored in a binary format
called [VelocyPack](https://github.com/arangodb/velocypack#readme)**, which is the same thing as JSON with offering
_more efficient storage and data manipulation_. **A document contains zero or more attributes**, each of these
attributesvhaving a value. A value can either be an atomic type, i. e. number, string, boolean or null, or a compound
type, i.e. an array or embedded document/object. Arrays and sub-objects can contain all of these types, which means that
arbitrarily nested data structures can be represented in a single document.

#### Document Example

Here is an example document record stored in ArangoDB:

```json
{
    "_id":"persons/alice",
    "_key":"alice",
    "_rev":"_cZCenLi---",
    "name":"Alice"
}
```

#### Document Key

A document key is a string that uniquely identifies a document **in a given collection**. Document keys are stored in
the `_key` attribute of documents. The key values are automatically indexed by ArangoDB in a collection's primary index.
The `_key` value of a document is immutable once the document has been created.

##### Key v.s ID

You probably see the difference in the [example above](#document-example). The `_key` is the "ID" of a collection,
whereas the `_id` is the "ID" of entire database and is unique across all collections within that database. Note the
difference is that `_id` is prefixed with a collection name (e.g. "person")

### Collection

Documents are grouped into collections. **A collection contains zero or more documents**. If you are familiar with
relational database management systems (RDBMS) then it is safe to compare collections to tables and documents to rows.
The difference is that in a traditional RDBMS, you have to define columns before you can store records in a table. Such
definitions are also known as _schemas_. _ArangoDB is by default schema-less_, which means that there is no need to
define what attributes a document can have. Every single document can have a completely different structure and still be
stored together with other documents in a single collection.

There are two types of collections

1. **document collection** - also refered to as vertex collections in the context of graphs)
2. **edge collections** - store documents as well, but they include two special attributes, _from and _to, which are
   used to create relations between documents. Usually, two documents (vertices) stored in document collections are
   linked by a document (edge) stored in an edge collection.

### Database

Collections are stored in databases. There can be one or many databases. The default database `_system` is special,
because it cannot be removed. Database users are managed in this database

### Query

Queries are used to

* filter documents based on certain criteria,
* compute new data,
* manipulate or delete existing documents.

ArangoDB query is written in [ArangoDB Query Language (AQL)](#arangodb-query-language-aql).

#### Cursor

Cursors are used to iterate over the result of queries, so that you get easily processable batches instead of one big
chunk.

### Index

Indexes allow fast access to documents, provided the indexed attribute(s) are used in a query. While **ArangoDB
automatically indexes some system attributes, including `_id`, `_key`, `_from` and `_to`**, users are free to create extra indexes on non-system attributes of
documents.

User-defined indexes can be created on collection level. Most user-defined indexes can be created by specifying the
names of the index attributes. Some index types allow indexing just one attribute (e.g. fulltext index) whereas other
index types allow indexing multiple attributes at the same time.

> ⚠️ Creating new indexes requires exclusive locking on collection. The collection is not available while the index is
> being created. This could be undesirable if you have to perform it on an on-flight application without a dedicated
> maintenance window.

#### Primary Index

**Each collection** has a primary index which is a persistent index for the document keys (`_key` attribute) of all
documents in the collection. _The primary index allows quick selection of documents in the collection using either the
`_key` or `_id` attributes_.

#### Persistent indexes

## ArangoDB Query Language (AQL)

### AQL Syntax

#### Query Types

An AQL query must either

* return a result (indicated by usage of the RETURN keyword) or
* execute a data-modification operation (indicated by usage of one of the keywords `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `REPLACE`,
  `REMOVE` or `UPSERT`).
  
The AQL parser will return an error if it detects more than one data-modification operation in the same query or if it
cannot figure out if the query is meant to be a data retrieval or a modification operation.

> AQL only allows **one** query in a single query string

#### Comments

Comments can be embedded at any position in a query.

AQL supports two types of comments:

1. Single line comments: These start with a double forward slash and end at the end of the line, or the end of the query
   string (whichever is first).
2. Multi line comments: These start with a forward slash and asterisk, and end with an asterisk and a following forward
   slash. They can span as many lines as necessary.

```
/* this is a comment */ RETURN 1
/* these */ RETURN /* are */ 1 /* multiple */ + /* comments */ 1
/* this is
   a multi line
   comment */
// a single line comment
```

An example AQL query may look like this:

```
FOR u IN users
    FILTER u.type == "newbie" && u.active == true
    RETURN u.name
```

### Data Queries

#### Data Access Queries

Retrieving data from the database with AQL does always include a `RETURN` operation, which is usually accompanied by a
`FOR` loop to iterate over the documents of a collection. The following query executes the loop body for all documents
of a collection called `users`. Each document is returned unchanged in this example:

```
FOR doc IN users
    RETURN doc
```

Instead of returning the raw `doc`, one can easily create a projection:

```
FOR doc IN users
    RETURN { user: doc, newAttribute: true }
```

For every user document, an object with two attributes is returned. The value of the attribute `user` is set to the
content of the user document, and `newAttribute` is a static attribute with the boolean value `true.

Operations like [`FILTER`](#filter), `SORT`, and `LIMIT` can be added to the loop body to narrow and order the result.

```
FOR doc IN users
    FILTER doc.status == "active"
    SORT doc.name
    LIMIT 10
```

##### Filter

The `FILTER` statement can be used to restrict the results to elements that match an arbitrary logical condition.

###### General Syntax

    FILTER expression

`expression` must be a condition that evaluates to either true or false. A condition contains Operators.

##### Operators

AQL supports a number of operators that can be used in expressions. There are comparison, logical, arithmetic, and the
ternary operator.

###### Comparison Operators

Comparison (or relational) operators compare two operands. They can be used with any input data types, and will return a
boolean result value.

The following comparison operators are supported:

| Operator | Description                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ==       | equality                                                    |
| !=       | inequality                                                  |
| <        | less than                                                   |
| <=       | less than or equal to                                       |
| >        | greater than                                                |
| >=       | greater than or equal to                                    |
| IN       | test if a value is contained in an array                    |
| NOT IN   | test if a value is not contained in an array                |
| LIKE     | tests if a string value matches a pattern                   |
| NOT LIKE | tests if a string value does not match a pattern            |
| =~       | tests if a string value matches a regular expression        |
| !~       | tests if a string value does not match a regular expression |

The comparison operators accept any data types for the first and second operands. However, `IN` and `NOT IN` will only
return a meaningful result if their right-hand operand is an array. `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` will only execute if both
operands are string values. All four operators will not perform implicit type casts if the compared operands have
different types, i.e. they test for strict equality or inequality (0 is different to "0", `[0]`, false and null for
example).

Some examples for comparison operations in AQL:

```
     0  ==  null            // false
     1  >   0               // true
  true  !=  null            // true
    45  <=  "yikes!"        // true
    65  !=  "65"            // true
    65  ==  65              // true
  1.23  >   1.32            // false
   1.5  IN  [ 2, 3, 1.5 ]   // true
 "foo"  IN  null            // false
42  NOT IN  [ 17, 40, 50 ]  // true
 "abc"  ==  "abc"           // true
 "abc"  ==  "ABC"           // false
 "foo"  LIKE  "f%"          // true
 "foo"  NOT LIKE  "f%"      // false
 "foo"  =~  "^f[o].$"       // true
 "foo"  !~  "[a-z]+bar$"    // true
```

The `LIKE` operator checks whether its left operand matches the pattern specified in its right operand. The pattern can
consist of regular characters and wildcards. The supported wildcards are `_` to match a single arbitrary character, and
`%` to match any number of arbitrary characters. Literal `%` and `_` need to be escaped with a backslash. Backslashes
need to be escaped themselves, which effectively means that two reverse solidus characters need to precede a literal
percent sign or underscore. In arangosh, additional escaping is required, making it four backslashes in total preceding
the to-be-escaped character.

```
    "abc" LIKE "a%"          // true
    "abc" LIKE "_bc"         // true
"a_b_foo" LIKE "a\\_b\\_foo" // true
```

The `LIKE` operator is case-sensitive.

The `NOT LIKE` operator has the same characteristics as the `LIKE` operator but with the result negated. It is thus
identical to `NOT (... LIKE ...)`.

The regular expression operators `=~` and `!~` expect their left-hand operands to be strings, and their right-hand
operands to be strings containing valid regular expressions as specified in the documentation for the AQL function
[`REGEX_TEST()`](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/functions-string.html#regex_test).

> ⚠️ Note that `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` work the same way as MySQL `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE`. In order to do fuzzy search with
> Arango `LIKE`, we have to include the `%` or `_` in search query. For example, the following query is not correct,
> which is why no match records were found:
>
> ![Error loading arango-like-incorrect.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-like-incorrect.png" | relative_url}})
>
> The next query, however, returns the expected results:
>
> ![Error loading arango-like-correct.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-like-correct.png" | relative_url}})
> 
> Notice the `%` character in the `LIKE` clause

##### Operations

###### LIMIT

The `LIMIT` statement allows slicing the result array using an offset (which specifies how many elements from the result
shall be skipped. It must be 0 or greater) and a count (which specifies how many, at most, elements should be included
in the result). It reduces the number of elements in the result to at most the specified number. Two general forms of
`LIMIT` are followed:

    LIMIT count
    LIMIT offset, count

The first form is identical using the second form with an offset value of 0.

> Variables, expressions and sub-queries CANNOT be used for offset and count. The values for offset and count must be
> known at query compile time, which means that you can only use number literals, bind parameters or expressions that
> can be resolved at query compile time.

> ⚠️ When LIMIT is placed before FILTER in query, LIMITing operation is executed before the FILTERing operations.

## Java API

### Troubleshooting

#### [Always Check for DB Existence Before Executing Query](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb-java-driver/issues/254)

Otherwise a runtime exception will break the application with the following error: 

```
Cause:class com.arangodb.ArangoDBException --> Msg:Response: 404, Error: 1228 - database not found
com.arangodb.ArangoDBException: Response: 404, Error: 1228 - database not found
```

We should make sure the table exists before executing query using, for example:

```java
ArangoDatabase db = ...

if (!db.exists()) {
    // execute logic on non-existing databases
}
```
