## Why Elasticsearch When We Have Lucene?

Elasticsearch provides a lot of benefits for users over apache lucene:

1. Convenience in programming

    * RESTful API support
    * Well organized & backward-compatible DSL Syntax
    * While Apache Lucene is considered a library, Elasticsearch is a independent platform which you could setup & run
      it separately from your services.

2. Scalability and High Availability

* Design for scaling horizontally (Shading Model)
* A fault-tolerant system using replication technique

3. Many Useful Toolkits - There are many community development around Elasticsearch such as [Kibana](./kibana.md),
[BigDesk](https://github.com/skroutz/elasticsearch-bigdesk), and [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash)

## Concepts

1. We inject data of anything into Lucene by a process called "indexing", which has 3 steps:
    - [Create `IndexWriter`](#step-1---creating-indexwriter)
    - [Construct all `Field`s](#step-2---creating-fields)
    - [Construct Documents](#step-3---creating-and-writing-documents-to-an-index)
2. After indexing, we can search the data via Lucene:
    - [Obtain `IndexSearcher`](#step-1---obtaining-an-indexsearcher)
    - [Format query](#step-2---creating-query-with-lucene-queryparser)
    - [Search](#step-3---performing-search)

### Indexing

#### Step 1 - Creating `IndexWriter`

The `IndexWriter` class provides functionality to create and manage index

```java
Analyzer analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer();
Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();
IndexWriterConfig config = new
IndexWriterConfig(Version.LATEST, analyzer);
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(directory, config);
```

The first argument is a `Directory` object. `Directory` is a location where the Lucene index is stored. Lucene provides
a number of directory implementations

* For performance or quick prototyping, we can use `RAMDirectory` to store the index entirely in memory.
* Otherwise, the index is typically stored in `FSDirectory` on a file system. Lucene has several `FSDirectory`
  implementations that have different strengths and weaknesses depending on your hardware and environment. In most
  cases, we should let Lucene decide which implementation to use by calling `FSDirectory.open(File path)`. 

The second argument is an `IndexWriterConfig` object where it holds the configuration information. 

An `IndexWriter` consists of two major components

1. directory
2. analyzer.

These are necessary so that Lucene knows where to persist indexing information and how to transform data of any kind
to searchable data stored in Lucene

##### `Analyzer`

`Analyzer`'s job is to analyse text. It enforces configured policies (`IndexWriterConfig`) on how index terms are
extracted and tokenized from a raw text input. The output from `Analyzer` is a set of indexable tokens ready to be
processed by the indexer.

An analyzer is a wrapper of three major components:

1. Character filter - preprocesses text before tokenization to clean up data
2. Tokenizer - splits up text into tokens; the output is `TokenStream` where the indexing process can consume and
   produce an index
3. Token filter - executes the post tokenization filtering

The analysis phase includes pre- and post-tokenization functions, and this is where the character filter and token
filter come into play.

Lucene provides a number of standard analyzer implementations:

* `StopAnalyzer`
* `SimpleAnalyzer`
* `StandardAnalyzer`
* `SnowballAnalyzer` (offers stemming)

#### Step 2 - Creating Fields

Indexing in Lucene involves creation of "documents". A Lucene document contains one or more fields

A Lucene field has three attributes

1. Name
2. Type
3. Value (can be a document itself)

A Lucene field can hold the following:

* String
* Reader or preanalyzed TokenStream
* Binary(byte[])
* Numeric value

This code snippet shows you how to create a simple `TextField`:

```java
new TextField("fieldname", text, Field.Store.YES)
```

Note that We have configured the field in the example above to store a value so it can be retrieved during a search.

#### Step 3 - Creating and Writing Documents to an Index

```java
Document doc = new Document();

String text = "Lucene is an Information Retrieval library written in Java";
doc.add(new TextField("fieldname", text, Field.Store.YES));

indexWriter.addDocument(doc);
indexWriter.close();
```

### Searching

Searching for data in Lucene is the same thing as "searching the index"

#### Step 1 - Obtaining an `IndexSearcher`

The `IndexSearcher` class is the gateway to search an index as far as Lucene is concerned. An `IndexSearcher` takes an
`IndexReader` object and performs a search via the reader. `IndexReader` talks to the index physically and returns the
results. `IndexSearcher` executes a search by accepting a query object.

Let's take a look at how we can obtain an `IndexSearcher`.

```java
Directory directory = getDirectory();
IndexReader indexReader = DirectoryReader.open(directory);
IndexSearcher indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(indexReader);
```

#### Step 2 - Creating `Query` with Lucene `QueryParser`

We perform search via `Query` object. Internally, Lucene processes `Query` objects to execute a search. `QueryParser` is
an interpreter that parses a query string into `Query` objects.

The syntax for query strings is as follows: a Query is a series of clauses. A clause can be prefixed by:

* A plus (+) or minus (-) sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited, respectively.
* Alternatively, a term followed by a colon, indicating the field to be searched. This enables us to construct queries
  that search multiple fields.
  
A clause can be:

* A term, indicating all the documents that contain this term.
* Alternatively, a nested query, enclosed in parentheses. Note that this can be used with a+/- prefix to require any of
  the set of terms.
  
```java
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("Content", analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse("Lucene");
```

Assuming an analyzer is already declared and available as a variable, we pass it into `QueryParser` to initialize the
parser. The second parameter is the name of the field where we will perform a search. In this case, we are searching a
field called **Content**. Then, we call **parse(String)** to interpret the search string Lucene into `Query` object.
Note that, at this point, we only return a `Query` object. We have not actually executed a search yet.

#### Step 3 - Performing Search

```java
final QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("Content", analyzer);
final Query query = parser.parse("Lucene");
final int hitsPerPage = 10;

final TopDocs docs = indexSearcher.search(query, hitsPerPage);
final ScoreDoc[] hits = docs.scoreDocs;

final int end = Math.min(docs.totalHits, hitsPerPage);
for (int i = 0; i < end; i++) {
    final Document match = indexSearcher.doc(hits[i].doc);
    
    ...
}
```

Here is a diagram showing how the search portion works between components:

![Search Diagram]({{ "/assets/img/lucene-search.png" | relative_url}})

A search string enters into `QueryParser.parse(String)`. `QueryParser` then uses an analyzer to process the search
string to produce a set of tokens. The tokens are then mapped to the `Query` object, and get sent to `IndexSearcher` to
execute a search.

> It is preferable to use the same analyzer for both indexing and searching to get the best results.
