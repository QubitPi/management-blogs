## Install Kibana

### Mac

#### Latest Version

Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install Kibana with the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the Elastic Homebrew repository:

```bash
brew tap elastic/tap
```

Once you've tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can install the latest version of Kibana:

```bash
brew install elastic/tap/kibana-full
```

##### Directory layout for Homebrew Installs

When you install Kibana with Homebrew, the config files, logs, and data directory are stored in the following locations:

| Type        | Description                                                                                             | Default Location                                     | Setting     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **home**    | Kibana home directory or `$KIBANA_HOME`                                                                 | `/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/kibana-full`         |             |
| **bin**     | Binary scripts including `kibana` to start a node and `kibana-plugin` to install plugins                | `/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/kibana-full/bin`     |             |
| **conf**    | Configuration files including `kibana.yml`                                                              | `/usr/local/etc/kibana`                              |             |
| **data**    | The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations | `/usr/local/var/lib/kibana`                          | `path.data` |
| **logs**    | Log files location                                                                                      | `/usr/local/var/log/kibana`                          | `path.logs` |
| **plugins** | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory                                  | `/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/kibana-full/plugins` |             |

#### Other Versions

It is a requirement to [install specific version of Kibana](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kibana) that matches your
Elasticsearch version, otherwise Kibana won't start properly. We will take version 6 as an example in the following
discussions.

To install Kibana 6, execute

    brew install kibana@6

For more information, see https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kibana

## Using Kibana

### Star Kibana

We need to tell Kibana where our Elasticsearch instance is so that it can connect to it when it starts. To do that,
specify the IP and port of the Elasticsearch instance in the Kibana config file, which should be
`/usr/local/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` on mac. Find a line that looks like `elasticsearch.hosts: [...]` and specify the
IP and port number of the Elasticsearch instance there, For example:
`elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://192.168.0.1:19200"]`. If the Elasticsearch instance requires authentication, locate
`elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` and put then authentication info there accordingly.

Now we can start Kibana in the following way (taking Kibana 6 as an example)

    $ brew services start kibana@6
    ==> Successfully started `kibana@6` (label: homebrew.mxcl.kibana@6)

#### Starting Kibana 7

    /usr/local/opt/kibana-full/bin/kibana

> Note: Updating config file requires a Kibana reboot, which is done via `brew services restart kibana@6`

When Kibana is up and running, we shall interact with Kibana UI at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

![Dashboard Screenshot]({{ "/assets/img/dashboard.png" | relative_url}})

### Browsing Data

#### Step 1 - Creating Index

Open up a browser and hit [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

![Creating Index Example]({{ "/assets/img/creating-index.png" | relative_url}})

Hit "Next step" and click through to create an index

#### Step 2 - Browsing Data

Go to the "Discover" tab on the left side of Kibana UI and you should be able to see the data under the index we just
created:

![Browsing Data Example]({{ "/assets/img/browsing-data.png" | relative_url}})

### Index

#### Deleting Index

Kibana doesn't support deleting index, but we could use its
[REST API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-delete-index.html) to do so

### Stop Kibana

`brew services stop kibana@6`

## Query Elasticsearch Through Kibana

Clicking the "Dev Tools" on the left panel, you should be able to see a welcome page that taches you how to send
Elasticsearch query from there:

## Kibana Query Language

The Kibana Query Language (KQL) is a simple syntax for filtering Elasticsearch data using free text search or
field-based search. KQL is only used for filtering data, and has no role in sorting or aggregating the data.

KQL is able to suggest field names, values, and operators as you type. The performance of the suggestions is controlled
by [Kibana settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/settings.html):

![Error loading kql-autocomplete.png]({{ "/assets/img/kql-autocomplete.png" | relative_url}})

### Terms Queries

A terms query uses **exact search terms**. _Spaces separate each search term_, and only one term is required to match
the document. _Use quotation marks to indicate a phrase match_.

```
http.response.status_code:400 401 404
```

For text fields, this will match any value regardless of order:

```
http.response.body.content.text:quick brown fox
```

To query for an **exact phrase**, use quotation marks around the values:

```
http.response.body.content.text:"quick brown fox"
```

Field names are not required by KQL. _When a field name is not provided, terms will be matched by the default fields in
your index settings_. To search across fields:

```
"quick brown fox"
```

### Boolean Queries

KQL supports

* `or`
* `and`
* `not`.

By default, `and` has a higher precedence than `or`. To override the default precedence, group operators in parentheses.
These operators can be upper or lower case.

To match documents where response is `200`, extension is `php`, or both:

```
response:200 or extension:php
```

To match documents where response is `200` and extension is `php`:

```
response:200 and extension:php
```

To match documents where response is `200` or `404`.

```
response:(200 or 404)
```

To match documents where response is `200` and extension is either `php` or `css`:

```
response:200 and (extension:php or extension:css)
```

To match documents where response is not `200`:

```
not response:200
```

To match documents where response is `200` but extension is not `php` or `css`.

```
response:200 and not (extension:php or extension:css)
```

_To match multi-value fields that contain a list of terms_:

```
tags:(success and info and security)
```

### Range Queries

KQL supports `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` on numeric and date types. For example

```
account_number >= 100 and items_sold <= 200
```

### Data Range Queries

Typically, [time filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/set-time-filter.html) is sufficient for setting a
time range, but in some cases you might need to search on dates. Include the date range in quotes.

```
@timestamp < "2021-01-02T21:55:59"

@timestamp < "2021-01"

@timestamp < "2021"
```

### Wildcard Queries

Wildcards queries can be used to **search by a term prefix** or to **search multiple fields**. The default settings of
Kibana prevent leading wildcards for performance reasons, but this can be allowed with an
[advanced setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/advanced-options.html#query-allowleadingwildcards).

To match documents where machine.os starts with win, such as "windows 7" and "windows 10":

```
machine.os:win*
```

**To match multiple fields**:

```
machine.os*:windows 10
```

This syntax is handy when you have text and keyword versions of a field. The query checks `machine.os` and
`machine.os.keyword` for the term "windows 10".

### Nested Field Queries

In the following document, `items` is a nested field. Each document in the nested field contains a "name", "stock", and
"category".

```json
{
    "grocery_name": "Elastic Eats",
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "banana",
            "stock": "12",
            "category": "fruit"
        },
        {
            "name": "peach",
            "stock": "10",
            "category": "fruit"
        },
        {
            "name": "carrot",
            "stock": "9",
            "category": "vegetable"
        },
        {
            "name": "broccoli",
            "stock": "5",
            "category": "vegetable"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Match A Single Document

To match stores that have more than 10 bananas in stock:

```
items:{ name:banana and stock > 10 }
```

`items` is the nested path. Everything inside the curly braces (the nested group) must match a single nested document

#### Match Multiple Documents

The following subqueries are in separate nested groups and can match different nested documents:

```
items:{ name:banana } and items:{ stock:9 }
```

* `name:banana` matches the first document in the array and
* `stock:9` matches the third document in the array.

#### Nested Fields Inside Other Nested Fields

KQL supports nested fields inside other nested fields. You have to specify the full path. In this document, `level1` and
`level2` are nested fields:

```json
{
    "level1": [
        {
            "level2": [
                {
                    "prop1": "foo",
                    "prop2": "bar"
                },
                {
                    "prop1": "baz",
                    "prop2": "qux"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To match on a single nested document:

```
level1.level2:{ prop1:foo and prop2:bar }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Kibana has started but UI is not Accessible

#### Problem

The command 

    brew services restart/start kibana@6
    
was successful, for excample, with the output of

    ==> Successfully started `kibana@6` (label: homebrew.mxcl.kibana@6)
    
But the UI is not responding: 

![Error loading kibana-ui-not-responding.png]({{ "/assets/img/kibana-ui-not-responding.png" | relative_url}})

#### Solution

Make sure kibana log is printing to terminal for potential investigations by identifying the following excerpt and
uncommenting the `logging.dest: stdout` in `/usr/local/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` as follows:

    # Enables you to specify a file where Kibana stores log output.
    logging.dest: stdout
    
Then start the Kibana through its native command:

    kibana serve
    
Errors should follow after the command above:

```bash
$ kibana serve
  log   [03:24:34.396] [fatal][root] { ValidationError: child "elasticsearch" fails because [child "hosts" fails because ["hosts" at position 0 fails because ["0" must be a valid uri with a scheme matching the http|https pattern]]]
    at Object.exports.process (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/node_modules/joi/lib/errors.js:196:19)
    at internals.Object._validateWithOptions (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/node_modules/joi/lib/types/any/index.js:675:31)
    at module.exports.internals.Any.root.validate (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/node_modules/joi/lib/index.js:146:23)
    at Config._commit (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/src/server/config/config.js:143:35)
    at Config.set (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/src/server/config/config.js:111:10)
    at Config.extendSchema (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/src/server/config/config.js:84:10)
    at extendConfigService (/usr/local/Cellar/kibana@6/6.8.12/src/plugin_discovery/plugin_config/extend_config_service.js:45:10) name: 'ValidationError' }

 FATAL  ValidationError: child "elasticsearch" fails because [child "hosts" fails because ["hosts" at position 0 fails because ["0" must be a valid uri with a scheme matching the http|https pattern]]]
```

The last line makes it clear that the Kibana failed to start because the Elasticsearch host URL was mis-configured. The
URL needs to be prefixed with `http/https`. **Open `/usr/local/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` and identify the
`elasticsearch.hosts` config key. A correct URL should look somethings like the follwoing:

    elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://192.168.0.1:19200"]
