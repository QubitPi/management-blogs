At Atlassian, great work is built on teamwork. They found that hiring great talent and using the right tools wasn't
enough. How we worked together, as a team, made the difference. The Team Playbook is a workshop resource built for
teams, by teams in Atlassian. This resource is shared with all teams so they can focus more on getting work done and
less on inventing ways of working.

4Ls Retrospective
-----------------

The 4 Ls is a retrospective technique where team members identify what they loved, loathed, learned, and longed for in a 
project or sprint of work. Using this simple framework, reflect back on your work and use what you've learned to improve
as a team.

* LOVED: what you loved about your work over the time period. This is what you want to keep doing, or do more of, in the 
  future.
* LONGED FOR: what you wish you'd had. It could be more people, more time, more coffee. Nothing is off the table.
* LOATHED: what made life worse back then. What do you hope will never happen again?
* LEARNED: what you learned from your successes and your mistakes.

For meeting starter, elaborate the following:

* The reason we're taking the time to talk about how we have worked is to see how we can make improvements.
* We're coming into this meeting understanding that everyone did the best that they could given their knowledge and tools.
* This meeting is a safe space. Nothing that is shared will be used against anyone.
* We're here to explore, not to blame.

During the meeting

1. Then set a timer for 5 minutes for people to add their own key events to the Milestone column.
2. Set a timer for 10 minutes for everyone to add their own thoughts to each of LOVED-LONGED-LOATHED-LEARNED lists.
3. Give everyone 10 minutes, as a team or in breakout groups, to discuss:
   - One action you'll take to remove something from your LOATHED list.
   - One action you'll take to amplify something from your LOVED list.  
   - Use your LONGED FOR and LEARNED lists to help shape your ideas for what actions to take.

> **Schedule your next 4Ls Play**
> 
> Once a quarter is a good start. Once you get the hang of it, try every two weeks, once a month, or after the end of a 
> project cycle or sprint.
>
> **Revisit regularly**
> 
> Make sure to revisit your 4Ls with the team and check in on the progress of your actions. At the next 4Ls, you can
  talk about how those actions went.
