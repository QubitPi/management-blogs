## Isolation Level

### Serializability

In applications like Web services, banking, or airline reservations, hundreds of operations per second may be performed
on the database. The operations initiate at any of thousands or millions of sites, such as desktop computers or
automatic teller machines. It is entirely possible that we could have two operations affecting the same bank account or
flight, and for those operations to overlap in time. If so, they might interact in strange ways.

The problem is solved in SQL by the notion of a "**transaction**", which is informally _a group of operations that need
to be performed together_. SQL allows the programmer to state that a certain transaction must be serializable with
respect to other transactions. That is, these transactions must behave as if they were run serially - one at a time,
with no overlap

### Atomicity

In addition to nonserialized behavior that can occur if two or more database operations are performed about the same
time, it is possible for a single operation to put the database in an unacceptable state if there is a hardware or
software "crash" while the operation is executing.

Certain combinations of database operations need to be done **atomically**, that is, either they are both done or none
is done.

### Transactions

The solution to the problems of serialization and atomicity is to group database operations into transactions.

A **transaction** is a collection of one or more operations on the database that must be executed atomically; that is,
either all operations are performed or none are. In addition, SQL requires that, as a default, transactions are executed
in a serializable manner.

When using the generic SQL interface, each statement is a transaction by itself. SQL, however, allows the programmer to
group several statements into a single transaction. The SQL command `START TRANSACTION` is used to mark the beginning
of a transaction. There are two ways to end a transaction:

1. The SQL statement `COMMIT` causes the transaction to end successfully. Whatever changes to the database caused by the
   SQL statement or statements since the current transaction began are installed permanently
   in the database. _Before the `COMMIT` statement is executed, changes are tentative and may or may not be visible to
   other transactions_.
2. The SQL statement `ROLLBACK` causes the transaction to abort, or terminate unsuccessfully. Any changes made in
   response to the SQL statements of the transaction are undone, so they never permanently appear in the database.

### Read-Only Transactions

If we tell the SQL execution system that our current transaction is readonly, that is, it will never change the
database, then it is quite possible that the SQL system will be able to take advantage of that knowledge. Generally it
will be possible for many read-only transactions accessing the same data to run in parallel, while they would not be
allowed to run in parallel with a transaction that wrote the same data.

We tell the SQL system that the next transaction is read-only by:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
```

This statement must be executed before the transaction begins. We can also inform SQL that the coming transaction may
write data by the statement

```sql
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
```

However, this option is the default.

### Dirty Reads

**Dirty data** is a common term for data written by a transaction that has not yet committed. A **dirty read** is a read
of dirty data written by another transaction. The risk in reading dirty data is that the transaction that wrote it may 
ventually abort. If so, then the dirty data will be removed from the database, and the world is supposed to behave as if
that data never existed. If some other transaction has read the dirty data, then that transaction might commit or take
some other action that reflects its knowledge of the dirty data.

Sometimes the dirty read matters, and sometimes it doesn't. Other times it matters little enough that it makes sense to
risk an occasional dirty read and thus avoid:

1. The time-consuming work by the DBMS that is needed to prevent dirty reads, and
2. The loss of parallelism that results from waiting until there is no possibility of a dirty read.

SQL allows us to specify that dirty reads are acceptable for a given transaction:

```sql
1) SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE
2) ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

The statement above does two things:

1. Line (1) declares that the transaction may write data.
2. Line (2) declares th at the transaction may run with the "isolation level" read-uncommitted. That is, the transaction
   is allowed to read dirty data.

> ![http://xyq.163.com/images/emote/32.gif]({{ "/assets/img/32.gif" | relative_url}}) So far, we have discussed 2
> isolation levels: [serializable](#serializability) and [read-uncommitted](#dirty-reads)

Note that if the transaction is not read-only (i.e., it may modify the database), and we specify isolation level
`READ UNCOMMITTED`, then we must also specify `READ WRITE`, because read-write transactions with dirty reads entail
significant risks. If we want a read-write transaction to run with read-uncommitted as the isolation level, then we need
to specify `READ WRITE` explicitly.




SQL provides a total of four isolation levels (2 of which have already been discussed above):

1. serializable
2. read-uncommitted
3. read-committed
4. repeatable-read

The latter two can be specified for a given transaction by

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

or

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

respectively. For each, the default is th at transactions are read-write. Incidentally, we also have the option of
specifying

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

However, this is the SQL default and need not be stated explicitly.

The **read-committed** isolation level, as its name implies, forbids the reading of dirty (uncommitted) data. However,
it does allow a transaction running at this isolation level to issue the same query several times and get different
answers, as long as the answers reflect data that has been written by transactions that already committed.

### Repeatable-Read

Now, let us consider isolation level repeatable-read. The term is something  of a misnomer, since the same query issued
more than once is not quite guaranteed  to get the same answer. Under **repeatable-read** isolation, if a tuple is
retrieved the first time, then we can be sure that the identical tuple will be retrieved again if the query is repeated.
However, it is also possible that a second or subsequent execution of the same query will retrieve phantom tuples. The
latter are tuples that result from _insertions_ into the database while our transaction is executing.

For example, consider a flight seat reservation problem. If we reserve seats under isolation level repeatable-read,
then a seat that is available on the first query will remain available at subsequent queries. However, suppose some new
tuples enter. For example, the airline may have switched the flight to a larger plane, creating some new tuples that
weren't there before. Then under repeatable-read isolation, a subsequent query for available seats may also retrieve the
new seats.

The table below summarizes the differences between the four SQL isolation levels:
