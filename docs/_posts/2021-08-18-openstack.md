The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform for all types of clouds, which aims to be simple to
implement, massively scalable, and feature rich. Developers and cloud computing technologists from around the world
create the OpenStack project.

OpenStack provides an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution through
[a set of interrelated services](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components). Each
service offers an Application Programming Interface (API) that facilitates this integration. Depending on your needs, you can
install some or all services.

> **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**
> 
> IaaS is a provisioning model in which an organization outsources physical components of a data center, such as
> storage, hardware, servers, and networking components. A service provider owns the equipment and is responsible for
> housing, operating and maintaining it. The client typically pays on a per-use basis. IaaS is a model for providing
> cloud services.
