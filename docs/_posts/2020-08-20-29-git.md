## GUI

### gitk

`gitk` is a graphical history viewer. This is the tool to use when you are trying to find something that happened in the
past, or visualize your project's history.

Gitk is easiest to invoke from the command-line. Just `cd` into a Git repository, and type:

    $ gitk [git log options]

Gitk accepts many command-line options, most of which are passed through to the underlying git log action. Probably one
of the most useful is the --all flag, which tells gitk to show commits reachable from any ref, not just HEAD. Gitk's
interface looks like this:

![gitk]({{ "/assets/img/gitk.png" | relative_url}})

On the top is something that looks a bit like the output of `git log --graph`; each dot represents a commit, the lines
represent parent relationships, and refs are shown as colored boxes. The yellow dot represents HEAD, and the red dot
represents changes that are yet to become a commit. At the bottom is a view of the selected commit; the comments and
patch on the left, and a summary view on the right. In between is a collection of controls used for searching history.

### Working with Remotes

To be able to collaborate on any Git project, we need to know how to manage our remote repositories. **Remote
repositories** are versions of our project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. We can have several of
them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for us. **Collaborating with others involves managing
these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when we need to share work**. Managing remote
repositories includes knowing how to

* [add remote repositories](#adding-remote-repositories)
* [remove remotes](#renaming-and-removing-remotes) that are no longer valid
* manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more.

* In this section, we’ll cover some of these remote-management skills.

#### Showing Project Remotes

To see which remote servers we have configured, we can run the `git remote` command. It lists the shortnames of each
remote handle we've specified. If we've cloned our repository, we should at least see `origin`, which is the default
name Git gives to the server we cloned from:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
Cloning into 'ticgit'...
remote: Reusing existing pack: 1857, done.
remote: Total 1857 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (1857/1857), 374.35 KiB | 268.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (772/772), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
$ cd ticgit
$ git remote
origin
{% endhighlight %}

We can also specify `-v`, which shows us the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and
writing to that remote:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
{% endhighlight %}

If we have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working
with several collaborators might look something like this.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd grit
$ git remote -v
bakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch)
bakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push)
cho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch)
cho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (push)
defunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch)
defunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push)
koke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch)
koke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push)
origin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)
{% endhighlight %}

This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily. We may additionally have permission to push
to one or more of these

#### Adding Remote Repositories

We've mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the `git clone` command implicitly adds the `origin` remote for us.
Here's how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname we can reference easily,
run `git remote add <shortname> <url>`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can use the string `pb` on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if we want to fetch all the
information that Paul has but that we don’t yet have in our repository, we can run `git fetch pb`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
* [new branch]      master     -> pb/master
* [new branch]      ticgit     -> pb/ticgit
  {% endhighlight %}

Paul's master branch is now accessible locally as `pb/master`. We can merge it into one of our branches, or we can check
out a local branch at that point if we want to inspect it.

#### Fetching and Pulling from Remotes

As we just saw, to get data from our remote projects, we can run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git fetch <remote>
{% endhighlight %}

The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that we don't have yet.
After we do this, we should have references to all the branches from that remote, which we can merge in or inspect at
any time.

If we clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name "origin". So,
`git fetch origin` fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since we cloned (or last fetched from) it.


> It's important to note that the `git fetch` command only downloads the data to our local repository. It doesn't
> automatically merge it with any of our work or modify what we're currently working on. We have to merge it manually
> into our work when we're ready.

If our current branch is set up to track a remote branch, we can use the `git pull` command to automatically fetch and
then merge that remote branch into our current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for us; and
by default, the `git clone` command automatically sets up our local master branch to track the remote master branch (or
whatever the default branch is called) on the server we cloned from. Running `git pull` generally fetches data from the
server we originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code we're currently working on.

#### Pushing to Remotes

When we have our project at a point that we would like to share, we have to push it upstream. The command for this is
simple: `git push <remote> <branch>`. If we want to push our `master` branch to our `origin` server (again, cloning
generally sets up both of those names for us automatically), then we can run this to push any commits we've done back up
to the server:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

This command works only if we cloned from a server to which we have write access and if nobody has pushed in the
meantime. If someone else cloned at the same time and they pushed upstream before we push upstream, our push will
rightly be rejected. We'll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into ours before we'll be allowed to push.

#### Inspecting a Remote

If we want to see more information about a particular remote, we can use the `git remote show <remote>` command. If we
run this command with a particular shortname, such as `origin`, we get something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  Push  URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
  master                               tracked
  dev-branch                           tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
  master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
  master pushes to master (up to date)
  {% endhighlight %}

It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information. The command helpfully tells us
that if we're on the `master` branch and we run `git pull`, it will automatically merge the remote's `master` branch
into the local one after it has been fetched. It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.

The example above is simple. When we're using Git more heavily, however, we may see much more information from
`git remote show`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  Push  URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
  master                           tracked
  dev-branch                       tracked
  markdown-strip                   tracked
  issue-43                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
  issue-45                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
  refs/remotes/origin/issue-11     stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
  dev-branch merges with remote dev-branch
  master     merges with remote master
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
  dev-branch                     pushes to dev-branch                     (up to date)
  markdown-strip                 pushes to markdown-strip                 (up to date)
  master                         pushes to master                         (up to date)
  {% endhighlight %}

This command shows which branch is automatically pushed to when we run `git push` while on certain branches. It also
shows us which remote branches on the server we don't yet have, which remote branches we have that have been removed
from the server, and multiple local branches that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when
we run `git pull`.

#### Renaming and Removing Remotes

We can run `git remote rename` to change a remote's shortname. For instance, if we would like to rename `pb` to `paul`,
we can do so with

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote rename pb paul
$ git remote
origin
paul
{% endhighlight %}

It's worth mentioning that this changes all our remote-tracking branch names, too. What used to be referenced at
`pb/master` is now at `paul/master`.

If we want to remove a remote for some reason - we've moved the server or are no longer using a particular mirror, or
perhaps a contributor isn't contributing anymore - we can either use `git remote remove` or `git remote rm`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote remove paul
$ git remote
origin
{% endhighlight %}

Once we delete the reference to a remote this way, all remote-tracking branches and configuration settings associated
with that remote are also deleted.

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork

You must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git to sync changes you make in a fork with the
original repository. This also allows you to sync changes made in the original repository with the fork.

1. Open Terminal.
2. List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

        $ git remote -v
        > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
        > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

3. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git

4. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

        $ git remote -v
        > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
        > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
        > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
        > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)

### Syncing a Fork/Update Forked Master Branch

First you need to pull off the most recent master from the original repository(the repository where you forked your copy).

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:xxx
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your forked master

```bash
git push origin master
```

## Commit

### Signing the Last Commit with GPG

```bash
git commit -S --amend
```

### Signing Multiple Previous Commits with GPG

Suppose we would like to resign last 2 commits of current branch, we can do 

```bash
git rebase -i --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -S' HEAD~2
```

### [How Can I Undo an Older Commit?](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-revert-old-commit/)

There are a couple of ways to "undo" commits in Git. The "reset" command, for example, allows you to restore your
project at any previous revision - effectively "undoing" all the commits that came afterwards. If this what you want to
achieve, read more about "[reset](#no-pull-request-available-rollback-latest-consecutive-pushed-commits)".

A different situation, however, is when you want to **undo the effects of only a certain commit** - and not discard any
commits that came after that one. This is a classic scenario for the "revert" command.

#### Reverting a Commit

Using the revert command doesn't delete any commits. Quite the contrary: it creates a new revision that reverts the
effects of a specified commit:

![git-revert-commit.png is not loade properly]({{ "/assets/img/git-revert-commit.png" | relative_url}})

The syntax to do this is easy. Just use the revert command and provide the commit you want to "undo":

```
git revert 0ad5a7a6
```

#### Change The Name of Directory Being Cloning into

    git clone https://github.com/sferik/sign-in-with-twitter.git signin
    
#### (No Pull Request Available) Rollback Latest Consecutive Pushed Commits

To preserve changes being rollback locally:

    git --reset soft <commit-hash> # commit-hash will be the one of new commit head after rolling back

Without preserving:

    git --reset hard <commit-hash>
    
#### Change Last Commit Message

```bash
git commit --amend
```

#### Squash Commits on master Branch

Suppose we have a commit history on master branch that roughly looks like this:

```
* commit 32fr3 
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Add tests
| 
* commit ef3f3
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Add .gitignore
| 
* commit dsfe3
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Initial commit
```

We could do

```bash
git reset --soft dsfe3
git commit --amend -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master -f
```

### Cherry Pick

1. [Squash](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit)
   cherry-picking commits to 1 commit
2. Take note on the hash of the commit that is to be cherry-picked
3. hard reset that working/feature branch to new base branch(which can be the same base branch or a new branch, such as
   `upstream/master`) - `git reset --hard base-branch-name`
4. `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
5. `git push origin my-branch --force`

#### Cherry-picking with Conflicts

What if there were conflicts when you cherry-pick. Git will pause the cherry-pick. You have to resolve the conflicts and
ask the git to continue with the cherry-pick.

![Error git-cherry-pick-with-conflicts.png]({{ "/assets/img/git-cherry-pick-with-conflicts.png" | relative_url}})

In the example above, I have tried to cherry-pick a particular commit but it has resulted in a conflict.

After resolving the conflicts, you can continue with the cherry-pick with command

    git cherry-pick --continue

If we decided to abort the cherry-pick with conflicts, we could use

    git cherry-pick --abort

#### Cherry-picking a Range of Commits

    cherry-pick A^..B

will cherry pick commits A through B (including both A and B)

### Undo The Last Commit

When you want to restructure the last commit extensively or discard it, the "reset" command is your best friend

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Reset will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision. In our example above, we'd like to return to the
one before the current revision - effectively making our last commit undone. The `--soft` flag makes sure that the
changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local
modifications in your working copy. If, however, you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the `--hard` flag

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Undo Multiple Commits

You can return to any previous revision using

```bash
git reset --hard 0ad5a7a6
```

where `0ad5a7a6` is the commit hash. The command undoes all commits that came after the one you returned to

### [Change Commit Timestamp of an Old Commit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41997774)

Each commit is associated with two dates, the committer date and the author date. You can view these dates with:

```bash
git log --format=fuller
```

If you want to change the author date and the committer date of the last 6 commits, you can simply use an interactive
rebase:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~6
```

    pick c95a4b7 Modification 1
    pick 1bc0b44 Modification 2
    pick de19ad3 Modification 3
    pick c110e7e Modification 4
    pick 342256c Modification 5
    pick 5108205 Modification 6
    
    # Rebase eadedca..5108205 onto eadedca (6 commands)
    #
    # Commands:
    # p, pick = use commit
    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
    # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
    # d, drop = remove commit

For all commits where you want to change the date, replace `pick` with `edit` (or just `e`), then save and quit your
editor.

You can now amend each commit by specifying the author date and the committer date in
[ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:

```bash
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2017-10-08T09:51:07" git commit --amend --date="2017-10-08T09:51:07"
```

> 📋 The first date is the commit date, the second one is the author date.

Then go to the next commit with :

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

Repeat the process until you amend all your commits. Check your progression with `git status` and

### Change Commit Author After Push

Amend the commit on your local repository and force push the change:

```bash
git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"
git push origin branch-name --force
```

### .gititnore

#### Ignore files in Git Without Adding Them to .gitignore

Usually, is better to ignore any files you don't want to track in either the project local `.gitignore` or your global
`.gitignore`.

But sometimes you just want a file to be included initially and be ignored afterwards. It it quite simple do to this.

##### Ignoring Untracked Files

This first example is on how to ignore untracked files. A file that is not tracked in git basically means a new file
from git's perspective (a file that you never `git add {file} && git commit -m "commit"`).

To ignore untracked files, you have a file in your git folder called `.git/info/exclude`. This file is your own
gitignore inside your local git folder, which means is not going to be committed or shared with anyone else. You can
basically edit this file and stop tracking any (untracked) file. Here's what the official
[Git - gitignore Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) says about this file.

> Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related
> repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user's workflow) should go
> into the `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` file.

So let's say you want to ignore your own custom "awesome-setup.sh" file that helps you with some stuff. You just need to
add the file to `.git/info/exclude` in the same way you would add it to `.gitignore`:

```
# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~

awesome-setup.sh
```

_This approach, though, doesn't work if you want to ignore files that are already being tracked by Git_.

##### Ignoring Files That are Already Tracked

    git update-index —assume-unchanged app/config/local/database.php
    git update-index —assume-unchanged app/config/local/app.php

With this, any changes in `app/config/local/database.php` or `app/config/local/app.php` will not show up in case I run
git status.

## Tagging

Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history
that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesn't change. Unlike branches,
tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.

### Creating a Tag

To create a new tag execute the following command:

```bash
git tag <tagname>
```

Replace `<tagname>` with a semantic identifier to the state of the repo at the time the tag is being created. A common
pattern is to use version numbers like `git tag v1.4`. Git supports two different types of tags

1. annotated
2. lightweight tags

The example above creates a lightweight tag. Lightweight tags and Annotated tags differ in the amount of accompanying
meta data they store. A best practice is to consider annotated tags as public, and lightweight tags as private.
Annotated tags store extra meta data such as the tagger name, email, and date. This is important data for a public
release. Lightweight tags are essentially 'bookmarks' to a commit, they are just a name and a pointer to a commit,
useful for creating quick links to relevant commits.

### Annotated Tags

Annotated tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. To reiterate, They store extra meta data such as: the
tagger name, email, and date. Similar to commits and commit messages Annotated tags have a tagging message.
Additionally, for security, annotated tags can be signed and verified with
[GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto). Suggested best practices for git
tagging is to prefer annotated tags over lightweight so you can have all the associated meta-data.

```bash
git tag -a v1.4
```

Executing this command will create a new annotated tag identified with "v1.4". The command will then open up the
configured default text editor to prompt for further meta data input.

```bash
git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
```

Executing this command is similar to the previous invocation, however, this version of the command is passed the `-m`
option and a message. This is a convenience method similar to `git commit -m` that will immediately create a new tag and
forgo opening the local text editor in favor of saving the message passed in with the `-m` option.

### Lightweight Tags

```bash
git tag v1.4-lw
```

Executing this command creates a lightweight tag identified as "v1.4-lw". Lightweight tags are created with the absence
of the `-a`, `-s`, or `-m` options. Lightweight tags create a new tag checksum and store it in the `.git/` directory of
the project's repo.

### Listing Tags

To list stored tags in a repo execute the following:

```bash
git tag
```

This will output a list of tags:

```bash
v0.10.0
    v0.10.0-rc1
    v0.11.0
    v0.11.0-rc1
    v0.11.1
    v0.11.2
    v0.12.0
    v0.12.0-rc1
    v0.12.1
    v0.12.2
    v0.13.0
    v0.13.0-rc1
    v0.13.0-rc2
```

To refine the list of tags the `-l` option can be passed with a wild card expression:

```bash
$ git tag -l *-rc*
    v0.10.0-rc1
    v0.11.0-rc1
    v0.12.0-rc1
    v0.13.0-rc1
    v0.13.0-rc2
    v0.14.0-rc1
    v0.9.0-rc1
    v15.0.0-rc.1
    v15.0.0-rc.2
    v15.4.0-rc.3
```

This previous example uses the `-l` option and a wildcard expression of `-rc` which returns a list of all tags marked
with a `-rc` prefix, traditionally used to identify release candidates.

### Tagging Old Commits

The previous tagging examples have demonstrated operations on implicit commits. **By default, git tag will create a tag
on the commit that HEAD is referencing**. Alternatively git tag can be passed as a ref to a specific commit. This will
tag the passed commit instead of defaulting to HEAD. To gather a list of older commits execute the git log command.

```bash
$ git log --pretty=oneline
    15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6 Merge branch 'feature'
    a6b4c97498bd301d84096da251c98a07c7723e65 add update method for thing
    0d52aaab4479697da7686c15f77a3d64d9165190 one more thing
    6d52a271eda8725415634dd79daabbc4d9b6008e Merge branch 'experiment'
```

Executing `git log` will output a list of commits. In this example we will pick the top most commit `Merge branch
'feature'` for the new tag. We will need to reference to the commit SHA hash to pass to Git:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2 15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6
```

Invoking `git tag` above will create a new annotated commit identified as "v1.2" for the commit we selected in the
previous `git log` example.

### ReTagging/Replacing Old Tags

If you try to create a tag with the same identifier as an existing tag, Git will throw an error like:

```bash
fatal: tag 'v0.4' already exists
```

Additionally if you try to tag an older commit with an existing tag identifier Git will throw the same error.

In the event that you must update an existing tag, the `-f FORCE` option must be used:

```bash
git tag -a -f v1.4 15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6
```

Executing the command aboe will map the `15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6` commit to the "v1.4" tag identifier.
It will override any existing content for the "v1.4" tag.

### Sharing: Pushing Tags to Remote

Sharing tags is similar to pushing branches. By default, _`git push` will not push tags_. Tags have to be explicitly
passed to `git push`.

```bash
$ git push origin v1.4
    Counting objects: 14, done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (14/14), 2.05 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 14 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@bitbucket.com:atlasbro/gittagdocs.git
     * [new tag]         v1.4 -> v1.4
```

To push multiple tags simultaneously pass the `--tags` option to `git push` command. When another user clones or pulls a
repo they will receive the new tags.

### Checking Out Tags

You can view the state of a repo at a tag by using the `git checkout` command.

```bash
git checkout v1.4
```

The above command will checkout the "v1.4" tag. _This puts the repo in a detached HEAD state_. This means any changes
made will not update the tag. They will create a new detached commit. This new detached commit will not be part of any
branch and will only be reachable directly by the commits SHA hash. Therefore it is a best practice to create a new
branch anytime you're making changes in a detached HEAD state.

### Deleting Tags

Deleting tags is a straightforward operation. Passing the `-d` option and a tag identifier to `git tag` will delete the
identified tag.

```bash
$ git tag
    v1
    v2
    v3
$ git tag -d v1
$ git tag
    v2
    v3
```

In this example `git tag` is executed to display a list of tags showing "v1", "v2", "v3", Then `git tag -d v1` is
executed which deletes the "v1" tag.

To delete a remote tag:

```bash
git push --delete origin tagname
```

## Branch        
        
### Remove All Local Branches But Keep Master

```bash
git branch | grep -v "master" | xargs git branch -D
```
    
### Rest Branch Back to Master

```bash
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### Git Stash Pop a Specific Stash

```bash
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{n}
```

### Rename Branch Locally and Remotely

```bash
git branch -m old-branch new-branch       # Rename branch locally
git push origin :old-branch               # Delete the old branch
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote
```

### Change Base Branch

Let's pretend you're actually in this situation:

    ---A---B---C <= Master
                \
                 E---F---F---H <= Foo
                              \
                              J---K---L---M <= Bar
                                           \
                                           N---O---P---Q <= Baz

And here is what we'd like to have…

    ---A---B---C <= Master
               |\
               | E---F---F---H <= Foo
               |\
               | J---K---L---M <= Bar
                \
                 N---O---P---Q <= Baz

Thankfully, Git has a solution for us in the options to the rebase command!

```bash
git rebase --onto [newParent] [oldParent] [branchToMove]
```

What this means can be broken down into parts:

* `rebase` - Change the parents of something
* `--onto` - This is the flag that tells git to use this alternate rebase syntax
* `newParent` - This is the branch that the branch you are rebasing will have as it's parent
* `oldParent` - This is the branch that the branch you are rebasing currently has as it's parent
* `branchToMove` - This is the branch that you are moving (rebasing)

The bit about "old parent branch" can be a little confusing, but what it's really doing is it's saying "ignore the
changes from my old parent when doing the rebase". The oldParent is how you define where the branch you are moving (ie.
`branchToMove`) starts.

```bash
git rebase --onto Master Bar Baz
git rebase --onto Master Foo Bar
```

Note that the order of these commands matter because we need to pull each branch off of the end of the "branch chain".

## Pull

### Pull Upstream Updates to Local Branch

If someone modifies your branch remotely, you might want to pull their changes into your local working branch. To do
that, use

```bash
git pull origin your-branch --rebase
```

This means pulling branch "your-branch" from remote repo "origin" into current local branch. With the --rebase flag, it
means to do the pull as a rebase pull, where the version w/o the `--rebase` flag does it as a merge pull

### Undo git pull

`git pull` does two things

1. it does a `git fetch`
2. then a `git merge` where it merges branches that have been setup to be merged in your config. So what you want to do
   is to undo the merge (undoing the fetch doesn't make a lot of sense and shouldn't be necessary).

To do that you can try using `git reset --hard` to reset to a previous state.

## Pull Request

### Restore PR Back to an Older Commit

The general approach is to checkout that particular commit using its commit hash, make a new branch, and push the new
branch to the remote old branch. Suppose you have a PR at branch called old-branch and you have 6 commits on that
branch. Now we want to restore your work back to the 3rd commit, whose commit hash is commit-hash. Here is how you could
do it (at local branch of repository)

```bash
git checkout commit-hash
```

This command put your work all the way back to the point of the commit with this commit-hash. Then we will create a new
branch and have this new branch override the existing remote branch

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

Before we can push the new branch, we need to rebase

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n # this is squash command, change n accordingly
git rebase origin/master
```

If there are conflicts, you need to execute the following commands after you resolve all conflicts

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

You need to resolve conflicts for all previous commits. At the end of each, you need to run the 2 commands above. Once
you are done, run

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

Now your new branch is good to be pushed

```bash
git push origin new-branch
```

The reason for pushing this new branch is for you to take a look at it online to make sure everything is right. If
everything looks good to you, then we are ready to push and change our old PR!

```bash
git push origin :new-branch        # delete remote(origin) new-branch
git branch -D old-branch           # delete local old branch
git checkout -b old-branch         # create new branch with the same old name, this branch comes from new-branch
git push origin old-branch --force # update the existing old-branch with the changes
```
