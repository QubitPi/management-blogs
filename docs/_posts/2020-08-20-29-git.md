### [How Can I Undo an Older Commit?](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-revert-old-commit/)

There are a couple of ways to "undo" commits in Git. The "reset" command, for example, allows you to restore your
project at any previous revision - effectively "undoing" all the commits that came afterwards. If this what you want to
achieve, read more about "[reset](#no-pull-request-available-rollback-latest-consecutive-pushed-commits)".

A different situation, however, is when you want to **undo the effects of only a certain commit** - and not discard any
commits that came after that one. This is a classic scenario for the "revert" command.

#### Reverting a Commit

Using the revert command doesn't delete any commits. Quite the contrary: it creates a new revision that reverts the
effects of a specified commit:

![git-revert-commit.png is not loade properly]({{ "/assets/img/git-revert-commit.png" | relative_url}})

The syntax to do this is easy. Just use the revert command and provide the commit you want to "undo":

```
git revert 0ad5a7a6
```

#### Change The Name of Directory Being Cloning into

    git clone https://github.com/sferik/sign-in-with-twitter.git signin
    
#### (No Pull Request Available) Rollback Latest Consecutive Pushed Commits

To preserve changes being rollback locally:

    git --reset soft <commit-hash> # commit-hash will be the one of new commit head after rolling back

Without preserving:

    git --reset hard <commit-hash>
    
#### Change Last Commit Message

```bash
git commit --amend
```

#### Squash Commits on master Branch

Suppose we have a commit history on master branch that roughly looks like this:

```
* commit 32fr3 
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Add tests
| 
* commit ef3f3
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Add .gitignore
| 
* commit dsfe3
| Author:
| Date:
| 
|     Initial commit
```

We could do

```bash
git reset --soft dsfe3
git commit --amend -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master -f
```

### GUI

#### gitk

`gitk` is a graphical history viewer. This is the tool to use when you are trying to find something that happened in the
past, or visualize your project's history.

Gitk is easiest to invoke from the command-line. Just `cd` into a Git repository, and type:

    $ gitk [git log options]

Gitk accepts many command-line options, most of which are passed through to the underlying git log action. Probably one
of the most useful is the --all flag, which tells gitk to show commits reachable from any ref, not just HEAD. Gitk's
interface looks like this:

![gitk]({{ "/assets/img/gitk.png" | relative_url}})

On the top is something that looks a bit like the output of `git log --graph`; each dot represents a commit, the lines
represent parent relationships, and refs are shown as colored boxes. The yellow dot represents HEAD, and the red dot
represents changes that are yet to become a commit. At the bottom is a view of the selected commit; the comments and
patch on the left, and a summary view on the right. In between is a collection of controls used for searching history.

##### Command Line [Side-by-Side Diff](https://www.jefftk.com/icdiff)

    git icdiff

### Git Config

```bash
git config user.name "<name>"
git config user.email "<email>"
git config --global core.editor "emacs"
```

#### Edit Global Config

```bash
git config --local --edit
```

### Fork

#### Configuring a Remote for a Fork

You must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git to sync changes you make in a fork with the
original repository. This also allows you to sync changes made in the original repository with the fork.

1. Open Terminal.
2. List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

        $ git remote -v
        > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
        > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

3. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
    
4. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

        $ git remote -v
        > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
        > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
        > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
        > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)

#### Syncing a fork/Update Forked Master Branch

First you need to pull off the most recent master from the original repository(the repository where you forked your copy).

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:xxx
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your forked master

```bash
git push origin master
```
        
### Branch        
        
#### Remove All Local Branches But Keep Master

```bash
git branch | grep -v "master" | xargs git branch -D
```
    
#### Rest Branch Back to Master

```bash
git reset --hard origin/master
```

#### Git Stash Pop a Specific Stash

```bash
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{n}
```

#### Rename Branch Locally and Remotely

```bash
git branch -m old-branch new-branch       # Rename branch locally
git push origin :old-branch               # Delete the old branch
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote
```

#### Change Base Branch

Let's pretend you're actually in this situation:

    ---A---B---C <= Master
                \
                 E---F---F---H <= Foo
                              \
                              J---K---L---M <= Bar
                                           \
                                           N---O---P---Q <= Baz

And here is what we'd like to haveâ€¦

    ---A---B---C <= Master
               |\
               | E---F---F---H <= Foo
               |\
               | J---K---L---M <= Bar
                \
                 N---O---P---Q <= Baz

Thankfully, Git has a solution for us in the options to the rebase command!

```bash
git rebase --onto [newParent] [oldParent] [branchToMove]
```

What this means can be broken down into parts:

* `rebase` - Change the parents of something
* `--onto` - This is the flag that tells git to use this alternate rebase syntax
* `newParent` - This is the branch that the branch you are rebasing will have as it's parent
* `oldParent` - This is the branch that the branch you are rebasing currently has as it's parent
* `branchToMove` - This is the branch that you are moving (rebasing)

The bit about "old parent branch" can be a little confusing, but what it's really doing is it's saying "ignore the
changes from my old parent when doing the rebase". The oldParent is how you define where the branch you are moving (ie.
`branchToMove`) starts.

```bash
git rebase --onto Master Bar Baz
git rebase --onto Master Foo Bar
```

Note that the order of these commands matter because we need to pull each branch off of the end of the "branch chain".

#### Cherry Pick

1. [Squash](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit)
cherry-picking commits to 1 commit
2. Take note on the hash of the commit that is to be cherry-picked
3. hard reset that working/feature branch to new base branch(which can be the same base branch or a new branch, such as
   `upstream/master`) - `git reset --hard base-branch-name`
4. `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
5. `git push origin my-branch --force`

### Commit

#### Undo The Last Commit

When you want to restructure the last commit extensively or discard it, the "reset" command is your best friend

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Reset will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision. In our example above, we'd like to return to the
one before the current revision - effectively making our last commit undone. The `--soft` flag makes sure that the 
changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local
modifications in your working copy. If, however, you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the `--hard` flag

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

#### Undo Multiple Commits

You can return to any previous revision using

```bash
git reset --hard 0ad5a7a6
```

where `0ad5a7a6` is the commit hash. The command undoes all commits that came after the one you returned to

#### Change Commit Author After Push

Amend the commit on your local repository and force push the change:

```bash
git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"
git push origin branch-name --force
```



### Pull

#### Pull Upstream Updates to Local Branch

If someone modifies your branch remotely, you might want to pull their changes into your local working branch. To do
that, use

```bash
git pull origin your-branch --rebase
```

This means pulling branch "your-branch" from remote repo "origin" into current local branch. With the --rebase flag, it
means to do the pull as a rebase pull, where the version w/o the `--rebase` flag does it as a merge pull

#### Undo `git pull`

`git pull` does two things

1. it does a `git fetch`
2. then a `git merge` where it merges branches that have been setup to be merged in your config. So what you want to do
   is to undo the merge (undoing the fetch doesn't make a lot of sense and shouldn't be necessary).

To do that you can try using `git reset --hard` to reset to a previous state.

### Pull Request

#### Restore PR Back to an Older Commit

The general approach is to checkout that particular commit using its commit hash, make a new branch, and push the new
branch to the remote old branch. Suppose you have a PR at branch called old-branch and you have 6 commits on that
branch. Now we want to restore your work back to the 3rd commit, whose commit hash is commit-hash. Here is how you could
do it (at local branch of repository)

```bash
git checkout commit-hash
```

This command put your work all the way back to the point of the commit with this commit-hash. Then we will create a new
branch and have this new branch override the existing remote branch

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

Before we can push the new branch, we need to rebase

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n # this is squash command, change n accordingly
git rebase origin/master
```

If there are conflicts, you need to execute the following commands after you resolve all conflicts

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

You need to resolve conflicts for all previous commits. At the end of each, you need to run the 2 commands above. Once
you are done, run

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

Now your new branch is good to be pushed

```bash
git push origin new-branch
```

The reason for pushing this new branch is for you to take a look at it online to make sure everything is right. If
everything looks good to you, then we are ready to push and change our old PR!

```bash
git push origin :new-branch        # delete remote(origin) new-branch
git branch -D old-branch           # delete local old branch
git checkout -b old-branch         # create new branch with the same old name, this branch comes from new-branch
git push origin old-branch --force # update the existing old-branch with the changes
```
