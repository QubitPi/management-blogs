Machine learning draws on ideas from a diverse set of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, probability and 
statistics, computational complexity, information theory, psychology and neurobiology, control theory, and
**Philosophy**. For example, in Philosophy:

* Occam's razor, suggests that the simplest hypothesis is the best.
* Analysis of the justification for generalizing beyond observed data.

**This post is purely my exploration of philosophical disciplines on the design and implementation of ML & AI
algorithms**, with an exclusive scope on **Immanuel Kant** Philosophy. I chose this topic because I believe any
successful ML & AI applications in the world of business must come from a _profound_ design and implementation of
some intelligent system which is not possible without some rigurous justifications. AI & ML, in my opinion, is about the
philosophy of learning applied on machines (I came to this conclusion after my
[university courses on Machine Learning](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs446/sp2015/resources.html)). The accuracy
of an intelligent algorithm pretty much depend on how we frame and bias a learning system. The approach to that requires
a solid understanding of learning theory, which is why it has been stated at the beginning of this post that Machine 
Learning draws from the discipline of Philosophy, and hence, I assembled this blog post.

How I ended up studying Kant's Philosophy for ML & AI is probably out of interests of most readers, but what I can tell
is that I found Kant's approach to human learning strategy works pretty well in many quotidian tasks in our daily lives.
I believe his rigorous treatise on learning theory will work for machine as well and help us design better ML & AI 
algorithms.


Critique of Pure Reason
-----------------------

The Critique of Pure Reason is a book by Kant, in which he seeks to determine the limits and scope of
[metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics). Also referred to as Kant's "First Critique", it was followed
by his Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and Critique of Judgment (1790). 

_Kant argues that our mathematical, physical, and quotidian knowledge of nature requires certain judgments that are 
"synthetic"_ rather than "analytic," that is, going beyond what can be known solely in virtue of the contents of the 
concepts involved in them and the application of the logical principles of identity and contradiction to these concepts, 
and yet also knowable **a priori**, that is, independently of any particular experience since no particular experience
could ever be sufficient to establish the universal and necessary validity of these judgments.

Kant agrees with Locke that we have no innate knowledge, that is, no knowledge of any particular propositions implanted
in us by God or nature prior to the commencement of our individual experience. But experience is the product both of 
_external objects_ affecting our sensibility and of the _operation_ of our cognitive faculties in response to this
effect, and Kant's claim is that **we can have "pure" or _a priori_ cognition of the contributions to experience made by 
the operation of these faculties themselves, rather than of the effect of external objects on us in experience**.

Kant divides our cognitive capacities into

1. our receptivity to the effects of external objects acting on us and giving us sensations, through which these objects 
   are given to us in empirical intuition, and
2. our active faculty for relating the data of intuition by thinking them under concepts, which is called understanding, 
   and forming judgments about them

This division is the basis for Kant's division of the "Transcendental Doctrine of Elements" into

1. the "Transcendental Aesthetic," which deals with sensibility and its pure form, and
2. the "Transcendental Logic," which deals with the operations of the understanding and judgment as well as both the
   spurious and the legitimate activities of theoretical reason

More discussion of "a priori" coming...
