## Troubleshooting

### IntelliJ Cannot READ Resource File

We sometimes see errors when we run unit tests in IntelliJ, saying "some resource file" cannot be found. We know the
path is absolutely right. If this is the case, it's simply a IntelliJ issue which is solved by simply loading those
resources explicitly by telling IntelliJ where those resources are:

![Error loading intelliJ-find-resource.png]({{ "/assets/img/intelliJ-find-resource.png" | relative_url}})

### Issue

I have Code Style -> Java -> Tabs and Indents set to the following.

Tab size: 4
Indent: 4
Continuation indent: 8

Tabs come out at 2 spaces when I hit TAB or Enter, not 4 spaces in `POM.xml`. I cannot find anywhere in the Settings
where the tab and indent are set to 2 spaces. I cannot control this. Why this is happening?

### Solution

1. "Settings | Editor | Code Style" -- try disabling "Detect and use existing file indents for editing" in case if you
   have it enabled (it is by default). NOTE: re-opening file in editor may be required.
2. Do you have any .editorconfig files anywhere in the path of that file? Settings from .editorconfig
   ("Settings | Editor | Code Style") have priority (will overwrite) over your IDE settings.
