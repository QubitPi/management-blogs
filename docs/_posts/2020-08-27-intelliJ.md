## Troubleshooting

### Issue

I have Code Style -> Java -> Tabs and Indents set to the following.

Tab size: 4
Indent: 4
Continuation indent: 8

Tabs come out at 2 spaces when I hit TAB or Enter, not 4 spaces in `POM.xml`. I cannot find anywhere in the Settings
where the tab and indent are set to 2 spaces. I cannot control this. Why this is happening?

### Solution

1. "Settings | Editor | Code Style" -- try disabling "Detect and use existing file indents for editing" in case if you
   have it enabled (it is by default). NOTE: re-opening file in editor may be required.
2. Do you have any .editorconfig files anywhere in the path of that file? Settings from .editorconfig
   ("Settings | Editor | Code Style") have priority (will overwrite) over your IDE settings.
