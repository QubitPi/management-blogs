## Introduction

[Linux Containers(LXC)](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/) are lightweight virtualization technology and
provide a free software virtualization system for computers running GNU/Linux. This is accomplished through kernel level
isolation, it allows one to run multiple virtual units(containers) simultaneously on the same host.

A container is a way to isolate a group of processes from the others on a running Linux system. By making use of
existing functionality like the Linux kernel's new resource management and resource isolation features(Cgroups and name
spaces), these processes can have their own private view of the operating system with its own process ID(PID) space,
file system structure and network interfaces.

Containers share the same kernel with anything else that is running on it, but can be constrained to only use a defined
amount of resources such as CPU, memory or I/O. By combining containers with other features like the Btrfs file system,
it will be possible to quickly set up multiple lightweight isolated Linux instances on a single host. Therefore
containers are better compared to Solaris zones or BSD jails.

Other benefits of containers are

* **Lightweight and resource-friendly** - Enables running multiple instances of an operating system or application on a
  single host, without inducing overhead on CPU and memory. This saves both rack space and power.
* **Comprehensive process and resource isolation** - Safely and securely run multiple applications on a single system
  without the risk of them interfering with each other. If security of one container has been compromised, the other
  containers are unaffected.
* **Run multiple distributions on a single server** - For example, we can run CentOS and Arch on Ubuntu host.
* **Rapid and Easy deployment** - Containers can be useful to quickly set up a "sandbox" environment, e.g. to test a new
  version of a Linux distribution or to simulate a "clean" environment for testing/QA purposes. When using the Btrfs
  file system for a container repository, new instances can be cloned and spawned in seconds.

## Install LXC on Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install lxc

## Use LXC

### Create an Ubuntu Container

    sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n <containerName>
    
### Start the Container

    sudo lxc-start -n <containerName> -d
    sudo lxc-console -n <containerName>
    
This will default to using the same version and architecture as your machine, additional options are obviously available
(`-help` will list them). Login/Password are `ubuntu`/`ubuntu`.

### Stop the Container

Once you are done, hit `Ctrl+a` then `q` to exit container console and stop the container using

    sudo lxc-stop -n <containerName>
    
### Get Info about a Container

In some cases when you need to know IP address of a container, you can do

    sudo lxc-info -n <containerName>
    
which will print various information about a container, including its IP address.

## LXC Web Panel

For Newbie I would recommend to use ***[LXC Webpanel](https://lxc-webpanel.github.io/install.html)***, The good part is
that if you make a container through cli mode, It will show up in LXC Web Panel

    sudo apt-get install lxc debootstrap bridge-utils -y
    sudo su
    wget https://lxc-webpanel.github.com/tools/install.sh -O - | bash

Open Web Browser and Connect `http://your_ip_address:5000/`. Login with user **admin** and password **admin**
