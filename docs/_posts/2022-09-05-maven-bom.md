Understanding dependency management in Maven is crucial to avoid getting version conflicts and wasting time resolving
them. Using the BOM is a good way the ensure consistency between the dependencies versions and a safer way in
multi-module projects management.

<!--more-->

As Java developers, we may maintain many applications using Maven for their dependency management. These applications
need upgrades from time to time to be up to date and to add new features or security updates.

This easy task - updating dependencies' versions - can easily turn out to become a nightmare because of conflicts
between certain dependencies. The resolution of these dependency conflicts can take a lot of time.

To make dependency management easier, we can use the **Bill of Materials (BOM)**, a feature that offers easier and safer 
dependency management.

Direct vs. Transitive Dependencies
----------------------------------

Let's imagine we write some business code that requires logging the output, using some String utilities, or securing the 
application. This logic can be implemented in our project, or we can use a library instead. It often makes sense to use 
existing libraries to minimize the amount of code we need to write ourselves.

The use of libraries encourages reuse since we will rely on other libraries that solve problems similar to ours: these 
libraries are our dependencies.

There are two types of dependencies in Maven:

1. **Direct Dependencies** that are explicitly included in our Project Object Model (pom.xml) file in the
   `<dependencies>` section. They can be added using the `<dependency>` tag.
2. **Transitive Dependencies**: a project that we include as a dependency in our project, like the logging library
   above, can declare its own dependencies in a pom.xml file. These dependencies are then considered transitive 
   dependencies to our project. When Maven pulls a direct dependency, it also pulls its transitive dependencies.


How Does Maven Resolve Version Conflicts?
-----------------------------------------

The first thing to know is that Maven can't sort versions: The versions are arbitrary strings and may not follow a
strict semantic sequence. For example, if we have two versions "1.2" and "1.11", we know that "1.11" comes after "1.2"
but the String comparison gives "1.11" before "1.2". Other version values can be "1.1-rc1" or "1.1-FINAL", that's why 
sorting versions by Maven is not a solution.

That means that Maven doesn't know which version is newer or older and cannot choose to always take the newest version.

Second, Maven takes the approach of the nearest transitive dependency in the tree depth and the first in resolution. To understand this, let’s look at an example:

We start with a POM file having some dependencies with transitive dependencies (to make it short, all the dependencies
will be represented by the letter "D"):

* D1(v1) -> D11(v11) -> D12(v12) -> DT(v1.3)
* D2(v2) -> DT(v1.2)
* D3(v3) -> D31(v31) -> DT(v1.0)
* D4(v4) -> DT(v1.5)

Note that each of the direct dependencies pulls in a different version of the DT dependency.

Maven will create a dependency tree and following the criteria mentioned above, a dependency will be selected for DT:

![Error loading transitive-dependencies-resolution.png]({{ "/assets/img/transitive-dependencies-resolution.png" | relative_url}})

We note that the resolution order played a major role in choosing the DT dependency since the "v1.2" and "v1.5" had the 
same depth, but "v1.2" came first in the resolution order. So even if "v1.2" is not the last version of DT, Maven chose
it to work with.

If we wanted to use version "v1.5" in this case, we could simply add the dependency D4 before D2 in our POM file. In
this case, "v1.5" will be first in terms of resolution order and Maven will select it.

Now it is clear for us how Maven resolves transitive dependencies. For some reason, we may be tempted one day to pick a 
specific version of a dependency and get rid of all the processes made by Maven to select it. To do this we have two
options:

1. [Overriding transitive dependency versions](#overriding-transitive-dependency-versions)
2. [Using BOM](#introducing-mavens-bill-of-material-bom)

### Overriding Transitive Dependency Versions

If we want to resolve a dependency conflict ourselves, we have to tell Maven which version to choose. There are two ways
of doing this.

1. **Override a Transitive Dependency Version Using a Direct Dependency** Adding the desired transitive dependency
   version as a direct dependency in the POM file will result in making it the nearest in depth. This way Maven will
   select this version. In our previous example, if we wanted version "v1.3" to be selected, then adding the dependency 
   `DT(v1.3)` in the POM file will ensure its selection.
2. **Override a Transitive Dependency Version Using the dependencyManagement Section**  For projects with sub-modules,
   to ensure compatibility and coherence between all the modules, we need a way to provide the same version of a
   dependency across all sub-modules. For this, we can use the **dependencyManagement** section: it provides a lookup
   table for Maven to help determine the selected version of a transitive dependency and to centralize dependency 
   information.

   A `dependencyManagement` section contains dependency elements. Each dependency is a lookup reference for Maven to 
   determine the version to select for transitive (and direct) dependencies. The version of the dependency is mandatory
   in this section. However, outside of the `dependencyManagement` section, we can now omit the version of our 
   dependencies, and Maven will select the correct version of the transitive dependencies from the list of dependencies 
   provided in `dependencyManagement`.

   > We should note that defining a dependency in the dependencyManagement section doesn't add it to the dependency tree 
   > of the project, it is used just for lookup reference.

### Introducing Maven's Bill of Material (BOM)

**The Bill Of Material** is a special POM file that groups dependency versions that are known to be valid and tested to 
work together. This will reduce the developers' pain of having to test the compatibility of different versions and
reduce the chances to have version mismatches. The BOM file has:

* a pom packaging type: `<packaging>pom</packaging>`.
* a `dependencyManagement` section that lists the dependencies of a project.

In the `dependencyManagement` section we will group all the dependencies required by our project with the recommended 
versions. Let's create a BOM file as an example:

{% highlight xml %}
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>reflectoring</groupId>
    <artifactId>reflectoring-bom</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>pom</packaging>
    <name>Reflectoring Bill Of Material</name>
    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>io.reflectoring</groupId>
                <artifactId>logging</artifactId>
                <version>2.1</version>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>io.reflectoring</groupId>
                <artifactId>test</artifactId>
                <version>1.1</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
</project>
{% endhighlight %}

This file can be used in our projects in two different ways:

1. [as a parent POM](#using-a-bom-as-a-parent-pom), or
2. [as a dependency](#adding-a-bom-as-a-dependency).

Third-party projects can provide their BOM files to make dependency management easier. For example, the Jackson project 
provides a [BOM](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-bom) for Jackson dependencies.

#### Using a BOM as a Parent POM

The BOM file that we created previously can be used as a parent POM of a new project. This newly created project will 
inherit the dependencyManagement section and Maven will use it to resolve the dependencies required for it.

{% highlight xml %}
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>reflectoring</groupId>
        <artifactId>reflectoring-bom</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </parent>
    
    <groupId>reflectoring</groupId>
    <artifactId>new-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <name>New Project</name>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.reflectoring</groupId>
        <artifactId>logging</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</project>
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, we note that the logging dependency in our project doesn’t need a version number. Maven will resolve it 
from the list of dependencies in the BOM file.

If a version is added to the dependency, this will override the version defined in the BOM, and Maven will apply the 
"nearest depth version" rule.

We should note that if we use a BOM as a parent for our project, we will no longer be able to declare another parent for 
our project. This can be a blocking issue if the concerned project is a child module. To bypass this, another way to use 
the BOM is [by dependency](#adding-a-bom-as-a-dependency).

#### Adding a BOM as a Dependency

A BOM can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the `dependencyManagement` section as a dependency with a
"pom" type:

{% highlight xml %}
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>   
    <groupId>reflectoring</groupId>
    <artifactId>new-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <name>New Project</name>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.reflectoring</groupId>
        <artifactId>logging</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependencyManagement>
    	<dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>reflectoring</groupId>
                <artifactId>reflectoring-bom</artifactId>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <type>pom</type>
                <scope>import</scope>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
</project>
{% endhighlight %}

Maven will behave exactly like the example with the parent BOM file in terms of dependency resolution. The only thing
that differs is how the BOM file is imported

The import scope set in the dependency section indicates that this dependency should be replaced with all effective 
dependencies declared in its POM. In other words, the list of dependencies of our BOM file will take the place of the
BOM import in the POM file.
