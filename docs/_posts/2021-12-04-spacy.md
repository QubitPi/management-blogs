## Install spaCy

[Install Python 3](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/2020/08/23/32-python.html#installing-python-3-on-mac-os-x)
first, then

    pip3 install -U setuptools wheel
    pip3 install -U spacy

The next step is to install the NLP model package, go to
[spaCy mode releases](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases) and choose one of "en_core_web_trf" packages,
e.g. [en_core_web_trf-3.2.0](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/tag/en_core_web_trf-3.2.0). The package
is a `tar.gz` file which can be installed using

    pip3 install en_core_web_trf-3.2.0.tar.gz

## Named Entity Recognition

### Example

Let's annotate part of a transcript for the
[First Trump-Clinton presidential debate](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_debate_at_Hofstra_University_(September_26,_2016)),
where Trump is talking about how he would bring more jobs to the American people:

```python
import spacy
from pathlib import Path
from spacy import displacy

text = "Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're go- ing to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisti- cated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car di- vision leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to num- bers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left - fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs."
