Setting Up a Minimized GraphQL Server
-------------------------------------

### Running Express + GraphQL

#### Running an Express GraphQL Server

The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a popular web application
framework for Node.js. You will need to install two additional dependencies:

    npm install express express-graphql graphql --save

##### [Setup Nodejs Project](https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb)

    npm install -g express-generator
    express --view="ejs" example

###### Config - package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "graphql": "*",
    "express-graphql": "*",
    ...
}
```

###### Config - app.js

We can use the 'express' module to run a webserver, and instead of executing a query directly with the graphql function,
we can use the `express-graphql` library to mount a GraphQL API server on the "/graphql" HTTP endpoint:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
var { buildSchema } = require('graphql');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
var schema = buildSchema(`
    type Query {
        hello: String
    }
`);

// The root provides a resolver function for each API endpoint
var root = {
    hello: () => {
        return 'Hello world!';
    },
};

var app = express();
app.use(
    '/graphql',
    graphqlHTTP({
        schema: schema,
        rootValue: root,
        graphiql: true,
    })
);

app.listen(4000);
console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql');

module.exports = app;
```

Run the server using

    npm install
    npm start

If everything is setup correctly, you should be able to see the following output:

    > graph-list@0.0.0 start
    > node ./bin/www
    
    Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql

Since we configured `graphqlHTTP` with `graphiql: true`, you can use the GraphiQL tool to manually issue GraphQL
queries. If you navigate in a web browser to [`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql), you
should be able to see an interface that lets you enter queries. It should look like:

![hello-graphql-server.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/hello-graphql-server.png" | relative_url}})

This screen shot shows the GraphQL query `{ hello }` being issued and giving a result of
`{ data: { hello: 'Hello world!' } }`. GraphiQL is a great tool for debugging and inspecting a server, so we recommend
running it whenever your application is in development mode.

This is how we would run a GraphQL server and to use GraphiQL interface to issue queries.

We can also do this from the command line with `curl`. If you paste this into a terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "{ hello }"}' \
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You should see the output returned as JSON:

```json
{"data":{"hello":"Hello world!"}}
```


GraphQL Specification
---------------------

### Document

> ```g4
> document : definition+;
> 
> definition : operationDefinition
>            | fragmentDefinition
>            | typeSystemDefinition
>            | typeSystemExtension
>            ;
> ```

A GraphQL **Document** is an ANTLR sequence of _definitions_. There are 3 types of definitions:

1. **Executable Definition**, which can either be a
   - [Operation Definition](#operation-definition), or
   - Fragment Definition
2. Type System Definition
3. Type System Extension

A GraphQL **Document** describes a complete file or request string operated on by a GraphQL service or client. A
document contains multiple definitions, either executable or representative of a GraphQL type system.

Documents are only executable by a GraphQL service if they contain an _Operation Definition_ and otherwise only contain 
_Executable Definition_. Documents which DO NOT contain _Operation Definition_ or DO contain _TypeSystem Definition or 
TypeSystem Extension_, however, may still be parsed and validated to allow client tools to represent many GraphQL uses 
which may appear across many individual files.

If a Document contains only one operation, that operation may be unnamed or represented in the shorthand form, which
omits both the query keyword and operation name. Otherwise, if a GraphQL Document contains multiple operations, each 
operation must be named. **When submitting a Document with multiple operations to a GraphQL service, the name of the
desired operation to be executed must also be provided.**

> To provide the desired operation to be executed from the following document containing 2 operations, for example
> 
> ```graphql
> query getTaskAndUser {
>     getTask(id: "0x3") {
>         id
>         title
>         completed
>     }
> 
>     queryUser(filter: {username: {eq: "Klee"}}) {
>         username
>         name
>     }
> }
> 
> query completedTasks {
>     queryTask(filter: {completed: true}) {
>         title
>         completed
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> When executing the request above (as an HTTP POST request in JSON format), specifying the "getTaskAndUser" operation 
> executes the first query:
> 
> ```json
> {
>     "query": "query getTaskAndUser { ... } \n query completedTasks { ... }",
>     "operationName": "getTaskAndUser"
> }
> ```

GraphQL services which only seek to provide GraphQL query execution may choose to only include _Executable Definition_
and omit the _Type System Definition_ and _Type System Extension_ rules from Definition.

### Operation Definition

> ```g4
> operationDefinition : selectionSet
>                     | operationType  name? variableDefinitions? directives? selectionSet
>                     ;
> ```

An **operation** is either

* a [set of selection](#selection-set), or
* a set of selection with operation

### Selection Set

```g4
selectionSet : '{' selection+ '}';

selection : field
          | fragmentSpread
          | inlineFragment
          ;
```

An operation selects the set of information it needs, and will receive exactly that information and nothing more,
avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching data. For example

```graphql
{
    id
    firstName
    lastName
}
```

In this query, the id, firstName, and lastName fields form a selection set. Selection sets may also contain fragment 
references.

### Fields

```g4
field : alias? name arguments? directives? selectionSet?;
```

A selection set is primarily composed of fields. A field describes one discrete piece of information available to
request within a selection set.

Some fields describe complex data or relationships to other data. In order to further explore this data, a field may 
itself contain a selection set, allowing for deeply nested requests. _All GraphQL operations must specify their
selections down to fields which return scalar values to ensure an unambiguously shaped response_.

For example, this operation selects fields of complex data and relationships down to scalar values.

```graphql
{
    me {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        birthday {
            month
            day
        }
        friends {
            name
        }
    }
}
```

Fields in the top-level selection set of an operation often represent some information that is globally accessible to an
application and its current viewer. Some typical examples of these top fields include reference to a currently logged-in
viewer, or accessing certain types of data referenced by a unique identifier. For instance

```graphql
# `me` could represent the currently logged in viewer.
{
    me {
        name
    }
}

# `user` represents one of many users in a graph of data, referred to by a
# unique identifier.
{
    user(id: 4) {
        name
    }
}
```

### Arguments

```g4
arguments : '(' argument+ ')';

argument : name ':' valueWithVariable;
```

**Fields are conceptually functions** which return values; they occasionally accept **arguments** which alter their
behavior. These arguments often map directly to function arguments within a GraphQL server's implementation.

In the example below, we query a specific user (requested via the `id` argument) and their profile picture of a specific
size:

```graphql
{
    user(id: 4) {
        id
        name
        profilePic(size: 100)
    }
}
```

In addition, multiple arguments can exist for a given field:

```graphql
{
    user(id: 4) {
        id
        name
        profilePic(width: 100, height: 50)
    }
}
```

> Arguments are unorderd
> 
> Arguments may be provided in any syntactic order and maintain identical semantic meaning. For example, the following
> two queries are semantically identical:
> 
> ```graphql
> {
>     picture(width: 200, height: 100)
> }
> ```
> 
> ```graphql
> {
>     picture(height: 100, width: 200)
> }
> ```


GraphQL Resolvers
-----------------

### What are GraphQL Resolvers?

After being validated, a GraphQL query is executed by a GraphQL server which returns a result that mirrors the shape of
the requested query, typically as JSON.

GraphQL cannot execute a query without a type system, let's use an example type system to illustrate executing a query:

{% highlight graphql %}
type Query {
human(id: ID!): Human
}

type Human {
name: String
appearsIn: [Episode]
starships: [Starship]
}

enum Episode {
NEWHOPE
EMPIRE
JEDI
}

type Starship {
name: String
}
{% endhighlight %}

In order to describe what happens when a query is executed, let's use an example to walk through.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Query</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

{% highlight graphql %}
{
human(id: 1002) {
name
appearsIn
starships {
name
}
}
}
{% endhighlight %}

</td>
<td>

{% highlight json %}
{
"data": {
"human": {
"name": "Han Solo",
"appearsIn": [
"NEWHOPE",
"EMPIRE",
"JEDI"
],
"starships": [
{
"name": "Millenium Falcon"
},
{
"name": "Imperial shuttle"
}
]
}
}
}
{% endhighlight %}

</td>
</tr>
</table>

We can think of **each field in a GraphQL query as a function or method of the previous type which returns the next
type**. In fact, this is exactly how GraphQL works. Each field on each type is backed by a function called the
**resolver** which is provided by the GraphQL server developer. When a field is executed, the corresponding resolver is
called to produce the next value.

If a field produces a scalar value like a string or number, then the execution completes. If, however, a field produces
an object value then the query will contain another selection of fields which apply to that object. This continues until
scalar values are reached. _GraphQL queries always end at scalar values_.

### Root Fields & Resolvers

At the top level of every GraphQL server is a type that represents all possible entry points into the GraphQL API, it's
often called the _Root type_ or the **Query type**.

In this example, our Query type provides a field called `human` which accepts the argument `id`. The resolver function
for this field likely accesses a database and then constructs and returns a `Human` object.

{% highlight javascript %}
Query: {
human(obj, args, context, info) {
return context.db.loadHumanByID(args.id).then(
userData => new Human(userData)
)
}
}
{% endhighlight %}

> 📋️ This example is written in JavaScript

A resolver function receives four arguments:

1. **obj** The previous object, which for a field on the root Query type is often not used.
2. **args** The arguments provided to the field in the GraphQL query.
3. **context** A value which is provided to every resolver and holds important contextual information like the currently
   logged in user, or access to a database.
4. **info** A value which holds field-specific information relevant to the current query as well as the schema details,
   also refer to [type GraphQLResolveInfo for more details](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlobjecttype).

### Producing the Result

As each field is resolved, the resulting value is placed into a key-value map with the field name (or alias) as the key
and the resolved value as the value. This continues from the bottom leaf fields of the query all the way back up to the
original field on the root Query type. Collectively these produce a structure that mirrors the original query which can
then be sent (typically as JSON) to the client which requested it.


GraphQL Java
------------

### Query Parser

We can parse a GraphQL query string into a programmable Java object, i.e. a [Document](#document), even without knowing
schema. For example:

```java
import graphql.language.Document;
import graphql.parser.Parser;

Document document = Parser.parse("{  Instrument(id: \"1234\") {    Reference {      Name    }  }}");
```

#### Retrieving Query Components through Visitor

##### Visitor Design Pattern

The purpose of a Visitor pattern is to define a new operation without introducing the modifications to an existing
object structure.

Imagine that we have a [composite](https://www.baeldung.com/java-composite-pattern) object which consists of components. 
The object's structure is fixed - we either can't change it, or we don't plan to add new types of elements to the
structure.

Now, how could we add new functionality to our code without modification of existing classes? The Visitor design pattern 
might be an answer. Simply put, what we will do is to **add a function which accepts the visitor class to each element
of the structure.**

That way our components will allow the visitor implementation to "visit" them and perform any required action on that 
element. In other words, we'll _extract the algorithm which will be applied to the object structure from the classes_.

Consequently, **we'll make good use of the Open/Closed principle** as we won't modify the code, but we'll still be able
to extend the functionality by providing a new Visitor implementation.

###### Example

![Error loading visitor-uml.png]({{ "/assets/img/visitor-uml.png" | relative_url}})

On the UML diagram above, we have two implementation hierarchies

1. specialized visitors, and
2. concrete elements.

The client uses a Visitor implementation and applies it to the object structure. The composite object iterates over its 
components and applies the visitor to each of them.

Concrete elements (`ConcreteElementA` and `ConcreteElementB`) are accepting a `Visitor`, simply allowing it to visit
them. This method is the same for all elements in the structure, it performs double dispatch (we will explain it blow) 
with passing itself (via the `this` keyword) to the visitor's visit method.

Our example will be custom `Document` object that consists of JSON (`ConcreteElementA`) and XML (`ConcreteElementB`) 
concrete elements; the elements have a common abstract superclass, the `Element`

```java
public class Document extends Element {

    List<Element> elements = new ArrayList<>();

    // ...

    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        for (Element element : this.elements) {
            element.accept(visitor);
        }
    }
}
```

> Note that the `Element` class has an abstract method which accepts the Visitor interface:
> 
> ```java
> public abstract void accept(Visitor v);
> ```

We will also have to implement `accept()` for all other elements, i.e. JSON element & XML element. Due to nature of the 
Visitor pattern, the implementation will be the same for both, so in most cases, it would require us to copy-paste the 
boilerplate code from other, already existing element:

```java
public class JsonElement extends Element {

    // ...

    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
```

```java
public class XmlElement extends Element {

    // ...

    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
```

> Note that `visitor.visit(this)` is the [double dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch) form 
> aforementioned.

Since our elements allow visiting them by any visitor, let's say that we want to process our Document elements, but each 
of them in a different way, depending on its class type. Therefore, our visitor will have a separate method for the JSON
and XML element type:

```java
public class ElementVisitor implements Visitor {

    @Override
    public void visit(XmlElement xe) {
        System.out.println("processing an XML element with uuid: " + xe.uuid);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(JsonElement je) {
        System.out.println("processing a JSON element with uuid: " + je.uuid);
    }
}
```

Here, our concrete visitor implements two methods, correspondingly one per each type of the Element. This gives us
access to the particular object of the structure on which we can perform necessary actions.

##### Using Visitor in GraphQL

Our action would be to read any component of a GraphQL query _programmatically_ and, thus, visitor would be a natural
fit.

GraphQL offers a public visitor API called **[NodeVisitor][NodeVisitor.java]**, which allows us to define our custom
action at each visit of GraphQL ANTLR component, such as SelectionSet and Argument. But, since it's an interface without
default implementation, are we going to implement all of these when all we need is two or three of those
implementations? No, because GraphQL offers provides a stub implementation called
**[NodeVisitorStub][NodeVisitorStub.java]**, with which we simply need to override what we care about. Here is an
example implementation that extracts the "0x3" from the query below

```graphql
query {
   getTask(id: "0x3") {
      id
      title
      completed
   }
   getAssignee(id: "EWGETBSDF") {
      name
      title
      department
   }
}
```

```java
import graphql.language.Argument;
import graphql.language.Document;
import graphql.language.Field;
import graphql.language.Node;
import graphql.language.NodeVisitor;
import graphql.language.NodeVisitorStub;

 * {@link TopSelectionFieldIdArgumentExtractor} is a visitor that, by the end of its visit of a {@link Document},
 * returns the first selection field argument value whose key is "id".

 *     <li> The {@link OperationDefinition} above must be defined by a {@link SelectionSet} and the argument must exist
