## Overview

Tez, an open source Apache incubator project, is a native Hadoop service built on
[Yarn](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.3.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) and the eventual successor of the
map-reduce framework. Tez is designed to execute DAG (directed acyclic graph) of tasks instead of batch processing data
like MapReduce. This makes Tez better for interactive queries used by Hive.

Tez also has made improvements over MapReduce that allows for faster response times and extreme throughput at petabyte
scale.

### Pluggable Inputs

Tez does not impose a data format on user applications. MapReduce applications can use key-value pairs; Hive and Pig can
use tuple formats that are native to each respectively.

### Simplified Map and Reduce

In a typical MapReduce execution without Tez, MapReduce executes a map and then a reduce function, writes to HDFS, runs
possibly more maps and reduce functions, etc., before getting the final result. You could think of this model as
something like MRMRMR.

Because Tez executes a DAG of tasks (also called flexible DAG), this execution model simplifies into MRRR and leads us
to the next reason for better performance.

### I/O Access to HDFS

With Tez, results aren't written to HDFS until the last reduce function is executed, which decreases network latency,
disk usage, and ultimately leads to faster processing. Reads are reduced as well because hot data is kept in RAM for
faster access (in-memory cache).

### Reduced Launch Latency

In the Map-Reduce engine, query startup is very expensive. The latency when launching jobs and tasks launch latencies
can add up to 5 to 30 seconds to the execution time for queries, which is especially bad for short queries.

Tez has a feature called Tez Sessions. A Tez Session that maps to an instance of an Tez Application Master (AM), which
is similar to a MapReduce job having a corresponding MapReduce Master being launched, except with one important
distinction: Each MapReduce job launches its own MapReduce AM, whereas, in one Tez Session, many DAGs can be submitted
to the Tez AM without the overhead of launching new AMs.

### Highly Customizable

Tez is targeted towards data-processing applications and bases computation as data-flow graphs with reusable 
primitives, such as sort, merge, etc. This allows Tez to meet the needs of a broad range of use cases (Hive, Pig,
Cascading, MapReduce, etc.).

## Why Tez Helps

Hive submits its query plan directly to Tez Service, so jobs are executed on an AM from the pool instead of starting a
new AM, removing job launch overhead. When maps and reduces complete, they can still pick up more work (container re-use)
rather than exiting, reducing latency and eliminating difficult split-size tuning.

Running on Tez, Hive can provide run-time query tuning by picking aggregation parallelism using online query statistics
(run-time reconfiguration of DAG). Tez's simplification of the map-reduce pattern becomes that much more important when
process complex Hive queries that at a large scale and require a high throughput.

## Performance Improvement

To illustrate the performance improvement, we'll benchmark the performance of Hive queries run on Hive 0.10 with
MapReduce and Hive 0.13 with Tez.

### Benchmark Overview

The table below describes the scope and specification of the benchmark:

|                    | Hive 0.10           | Hive 0.13           |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Benchmark Standard | TPC-H               | TPC-H               |
| Cluster Size       | 300                 | 300                 |
| Data set Sizes     | 100 GB, 1 TB, 10 TB | 100 GB, 1 TB, 10 TB |
| Hadoop Version     | 0.23                | 0.23                |
| File Format        | RCFile              | ORC File            |
| Security           | None                | None                |
| Engine             | MapReduce           | Tez                 |
| Vectorizaton       | No                  | Yes                 |

>Note: TCP-H consists of a suite of business-oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications.
