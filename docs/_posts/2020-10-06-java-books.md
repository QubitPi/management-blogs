#### Sequence UML Diagram

Sequence diagrams are probably the most important UML diagrams among not only the computer science community but also as
design-level models for business application development. Lately, they have become popular in depicting business
processes, because of their visually self-explanatory nature.

As the name suggests, sequence diagrams describe the sequence of messages and interactions that happen between actors
and objects. Actors or objects can be active only when needed or when another object wants to communicate with them. All
communication is represented in a chronological manner.

The best Sequence Diagram maker is [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/):
