Deploying Jenkins to AWS
------------------------

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of AWS Services, including: AWS CodeCommit,
AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot, and Amazon EC2 Fleet. We can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a
Jenkins application on AWS.

This section documents the process of deploying a Jenkins application. We will launch an EC2 instance, install Jenkins
on that instance, and configure Jenkins to automatically spin up Jenkins agents if build abilities need to be augmented
on the instance.

> üìã **Prerequisites**
>
> 1. [Register an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start), if not having one yet.
> 2. [An Amazon EC2 key pair](#creating-a-key-pair), if we don't have one yet

### Creating a Key Pair

Creating a key pair helps ensure that the correct form of authentication is used when we install Jenkins.

To create our key pair:

1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and sign in.
2. In the navigation pane, under **NETWORK & SECURITY**, select **Key Pairs**.
3. Select **Create key pair**.
4. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that we
   specify as the **key name**. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It cannot include leading or trailing
   spaces.
5. For **File format**, select the format in which to save the private key.
    - For OpenSSH compatibility (Linux or Mac OS X), select pem.
    - For PuTTY compatibility (Windows), select ppk.
6. Select **Create key pair**.
7. The private key file downloads automatically. The base file name is the name we specified as the name of our key
   pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format we chose. Save the private key file in a safe
   place.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the only chance for us to save the private key file.

8. If we use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to our Linux instance, we would also run the
   following command to set the permissions of our private key file so that only we can read it, otherwise we won't be
   able to connect to our instance using this key pair. For more information, please refer to
   [Error: Unprotected private key file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#troubleshoot-unprotected-key).

   ```bash
   $ chmod 400 <key_pair_name>.pem
   ```

### Creating a Security Group

A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach one or more EC2 instances. When we launch
an instance, we can assign it one or more security groups. We add rules that control the traffic allowed to reach the
instances in each security group. We can modify a security group's rules any time, and the new rules take effect
_immediately_.

To create and configure our security group:

1. Decide who may access our instance. For example, a single computer or all trusted computers on a network. For a
   single computer/user, we can use the public IP address of the computer/user. To find the IP address, use the
   [check IP service tool](http://checkip.amazonaws.com/) from AWS3 (this tool works for VPN as well) or search for the
   phrase "what is my IP address" in any search engine.
2. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
3. Open the Amazon EC2 console by selecting **EC2** under **Compute**.

   ![Error loading ec2-service.png]({{ "/assets/img/ec2-service.png" | relative_url}})

4. In the left-hand navigation bar, select **Security Groups**, and then select **Create Security Group**.

   ![Error loading create-security-group.png]({{ "/assets/img/create-security-group.png" | relative_url}})

5. In **Security group name**, enter **WebServerSG** or any preferred name of our choice, and provide a description.
6. Select our VPC from the list. We can use the default VPC.
7. On the **Inbound tab**, add the rules as follows:
    - Select **Add Rule**, and then select **SSH** from the Type list.
    - Under Source, select **Custom**, and in the text box, enter the IP address from step 1.
    - Select **Add Rule**, and then select **HTTP** from the Type list.
    - Select **Add Rule**, and then select **Custom TCP Rule** from the Type list.
    - Under **Port Range**, enter **8080** (Jenkins UI port).
8. Select Create.

For more information, refer to
[Security Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the Amazon EC2 User
Guide for Linux Instances.

### Launching an Amazon EC2 Instance

To launch an EC2 instance:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. Open the Amazon EC2 console by selecting EC2 under **Compute**.
3. From the Amazon EC2 dashboard, select **Launch Instance**.

![Error loading ec2-launch-instance.png]({{ "/assets/img/ec2-launch-instance.png" | relative_url}})

4. We will run Ubuntu OS in our instance, so let's pick up "Ubuntu" and give it a name such as "Jenkins Server"

![Error loading ec2-instance-setup.png]({{ "/assets/img/ec2-instance-setup.png" | relative_url}})

5. On the Choose an Instance Type page, the **t2.micro** instance is selected by default. Verify this instance type is
   selected to stay within the free tier.
6. Pick up the Key Pair (under "Key pair" section) and the security group (under "Network settings") we defined previously
7. Hit "Launch Instance"
8. In the left-hand navigation bar, choose Instances to view the status of our instance. Initially, the status of our
   instance is pending. After the status changes to running, our instance is ready for use.

   ![Error loading ec2-view-created-instance.png]({{ "/assets/img/ec2-view-created-instance.png" | relative_url}})

### Installing Jenkins

Now that the Amazon EC2 instance has been launched, Jenkins can be installed properly.

In this step we will deploy Jenkins on our EC2 instance by completing the following tasks:

1. [Connecting to Our Linux Instance](#connecting-to-our-linux-instance)
2. [Downloading and Installing Jenkins](#downloading-and-installing-jenkins)
3. [Configuring Jenkins](#configuring-jenkins)

#### Connecting to Our Linux Instance

After we launch our instance, we can connect to it and use it the same way as our local machine.

Before we connect to our instance, get the public DNS name of the instance using the Amazon EC2 console.

![Error loading ec2-public-dns.png]({{ "/assets/img/ec2-public-dns.png" | relative_url}})

Use the `ssh` command to connect to the instance. We will specify the private key (.pem) file and
`ec2-user@public_dns_name`.

```bash
ssh -i "/path/my-key-pair.pem" ubuntu@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

We will receive a response like the following:

```bash
The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute1.amazonaws.com (10.254.142.33)' cant be
established.

RSA key fingerprint is 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting
(yes/no)?
```

Enter "yes". We will receive a response like the following:

```bash
Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute1.amazonaws.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

#### Downloading and Installing Jenkins

##### Installing Java

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions don't include this by default and some Java versions
are incompatible with Jenkins, because **Jenkins requires Java 11 or 17 since Jenkins 2.357 and LTS 2.361.1**.

There are multiple Java implementations which we can use. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) is the most popular one
at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 11, and check the installation with the commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)
```

##### Installing Jenkins

On Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, i.e. our EC2 base image, we can install Jenkins through `apt`.

###### Long Term Support Release

A Jenkins [LTS (Long-Term Support) release](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/) is chosen every 12 weeks from the
stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the
[debian-stable apt repository](https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

Beginning with Jenkins 2.335 and Jenkins 2.332.1, the package is configured with **systemd** rather than the older System
V init, so we would use systemd extensively to configure Jenkins next.

The package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. Run **`systemctl cat jenkins`** for more details.
* Create a "**jenkins**" user to run this service. This username is very important because it would be used latter
  during [HTTPS/SSL configuration](#enable-ssl-on-jenkins-server-ubuntu)
  
  > üí° To verify user "jenkins" has been created, run `cat /etc/passwd`. Every user on a Linux system, whether created
  > as an account for a real human being or associated with a particular service or system function, is stored in a file 
  > called "**/etc/passwd**", which contains information about the users on the system. Each line describes a distinct 
  > user.
  
* Direct console log output to `systemd-journald`. Run **`journalctl -u jenkins.service -r`** if we are troubleshooting
  Jenkins.
* Populate `/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with our browser to start configuration. Note that this is not
  a secure port because it is a HTTP port. We would change this port in a moment for better security.

###### Weekly Release

Alternatively, a new release is produced weekly to deliver bug fixes and features to users and plugin developers. It can
be installed from the [debian apt repository](https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
  
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

### Enable SSL on Jenkins Server (Ubuntu)

It is very important to secure Jenkins by enabling SSL which runs in a project environment. This section is designed to
introduce the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) application-level protocol, and particularly the OpenSSL implementation of
SSL, in the context of using in Jenkins. After a brief description of exactly what OpenSSL is, and what it is useful
for, the section will further illustrate the practical usage of OpenSSL in Jenkins service for the purpose of serving
secured Jenkins resources from our EC2 instance.

While previous familiarity with Server Sockets Layer (SSL), or the OpenSSL implementation in particular, is not required
for this section, if desired, the reader is advised to pursue further learning from the [resources](#resources) listed
below in order to broaden his/her understanding of this powerful security layer.

#### About OpenSSL

**Secure Sockets Layer** is an application-level protocol which was developed by the Netscape Corporation for the
purpose of transmitting sensitive information, such as Credit Card details, via the Internet. SSL works by using a
private key to encrypt data transferred over the SSL-enabled connection, thus thwarting eavesdropping of the
information. The most popular use of SSL is in conjunction with web browsing (using the HTTP protocol), but many network
applications can benefit from using SSL. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with "https:" instead
of "http:"

**OpenSSL** is a robust, commercial-grade implementation of SSL tools, and related general purpose library based upon
SSLeay, developed by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. OpenSSL is available as an Open Source equivalent to commercial
implementations of SSL via an [Apache-style license](http://www.openssl.org/source/license.html).

##### About X.509

X.509 is a specification for digital certificates published by the International Telecommunications Union -
Telecommunication (ITU-T). It specifies information and attributes required for the identification of a person or a
computer system, and is used for secure management and distribution of digitally signed certificates across secure
Internet networks. OpenSSL most commonly uses X.509 certificates.

#### Installing OpenSSL Toolkit

AWS EC2 instance usually have OpenSSL installed and configured properly.

#### Generating SSL Certificates

Once we have properly generated an X.509-compliant SSL certificate, we may either elect to

* sign the certificate by ourselves by [generating a Certificate Authority (CA)](#self-signing-a-certificate), or
* have a globally recognized Certificate Authority [sign the certificate](#applying-for-a-certificate-using-certbot). We 
  can use services such as [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for valid SSL certificates. But these certificates
  have to be renewed every three months.

When the certificate is signed, it is then ready to be used with the OpenSSL toolkit, or the library to enable encrypted
SSL connections to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, (LDAP) or Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) server, for
example. The following sections describe the certificate generation, and signing process for both self-signed, and
recognized CA-signed certificates.

> Note that this section has no Jenkins involved and sets up SSL in a more general context

##### Self-signing a Certificate

###### Establishing a Certificate Authority

Self-signed certificates have a major advantage in that they are completely free to use, and they may be generated,
signed, and used on an as-needed basis. Self-signed certificates are great for use in closed-lab environments or for
testing purposes. One of the drawbacks of using self-signed certificates, however, is that warnings will typically be
issued by a user's Web browser, and other applications, upon accessing an SSL-secured server that uses a self-signed
certificate. By default, client applications (e.g., Firefox) will suppress such warnings for certificates that are
signed using only a globally-recognized and trusted Certificate Authority, but warnings may also be squelched by
importing a server's root certificate into client applications; a relevant demonstration is shown later in this guide.
Using self-signed certificates in a publicly-accessible, production environment is not recommended due to the implicit
trust issues arising from these warnings, in addition to the potential confusion caused to users.

> üìã We must obtain a certificate signed by a recognized Certificate Authority in order to establish a commercial site,
> e.g., for conducting "e-commerce", which is however not the case in the context of Jenkins we deiscuss here

Provided we've have the OpenSSL toolkit properly installed on our EC2 instance, the generation of X.509 SSL certificates
is quite simple. For self-signed certificates, we must **first establish a Certificate Authority (CA)** by following the
steps below:

First, create an initial working environment, for example within our home directory by issuing the following command
from a terminal prompt:

```bash
cd && mkdir -p myCA/signedcerts && mkdir myCA/private && cd myCA
```

The above command will place us in a newly-created subdirectory of our home directory named "myCA", and within this
subdirectory, we should have two additional subdirectories named "signedcerts" and "private".

Within this initial working environment, the significance of the subdirectories, and their contents is as follows:

1. `~/myCA`: contains CA certificate, certificates database, generated certificates, keys, and requests
2. `~/myCA/signedcerts`: contains copies of each signed certificate
3. `~/myCA/private`: contains the private key

Next, create an initial certificate database in the `~/myCA` subdirectory with the following command at a terminal
prompt:

```bash
echo '01' > serial  && touch index.txt
```

Now create an initial **caconfig.cnf** file suitable for the creation of CA certificates. Using our favorite editor,
edit the file `~/myCA/caconfig.cnf`, and insert the following content into the file:

```bash
sudo nano ~/myCA/caconfig.cnf
```

```conf
# My sample caconfig.cnf file.
#
# Default configuration to use when one is not provided on the command line.
#
[ ca ]
default_ca      = local_ca
#
#
# Default location of directories and files needed to generate certificates.
#
[ local_ca ]
dir             = /home/<username>/myCA
certificate     = $dir/cacert.pem
database        = $dir/index.txt
new_certs_dir   = $dir/signedcerts
private_key     = $dir/private/cakey.pem
serial          = $dir/serial
#       
#
# Default expiration and encryption policies for certificates.
#
default_crl_days        = 365
default_days            = 1825
default_md              = sha1
#       
policy          = local_ca_policy
x509_extensions = local_ca_extensions
#
#
# Copy extensions specified in the certificate request
#
copy_extensions = copy
#       
#
# Default policy to use when generating server certificates.  The following
# fields must be defined in the server certificate.
#
[ local_ca_policy ]
commonName              = supplied
stateOrProvinceName     = supplied
countryName             = supplied
emailAddress            = supplied
organizationName        = supplied
organizationalUnitName  = supplied
#       
#
# x509 extensions to use when generating server certificates.
#
[ local_ca_extensions ]
basicConstraints        = CA:false
#       
#
# The default root certificate generation policy.
#
[ req ]
default_bits    = 2048
default_keyfile = /home/<username>/myCA/private/cakey.pem
default_md      = sha1
#       
prompt                  = no
distinguished_name      = root_ca_distinguished_name
x509_extensions         = root_ca_extensions
#
#
# Root Certificate Authority distinguished name.  Change these fields to match
# your local environment!
#
[ root_ca_distinguished_name ]
commonName              = MyOwn Root Certificate Authority
stateOrProvinceName     = NC
countryName             = US
emailAddress            = root@tradeshowhell.com
organizationName        = Trade Show Hell
organizationalUnitName  = IT Department
#       
[ root_ca_extensions ]
basicConstraints        = CA:true
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**
>
> Make sure to adjust the site-specific details in the file, such as the two instances of `/home/<username>/` under
> `[ local_ca ]` and `[ req ]`. Also change `commonName`, `stateOrProvinceName` `countryName` etc under
> `[ root_ca_distinguished_name ]` accordingly. For more information on the directives contained within this
> configuration file, use the `man config` command.

When we've edited the file to match our environment, save the file as `~/myCA/caconfig.cnf`.

Next, we need to generate the **Certificate Authority Root Certificate** and **Key**, by issuing a few commands. First,
do this:

```bash
export OPENSSL_CONF=~/myCA/caconfig.cnf
```

The previous command sets an environment variable, `OPENSSL_CONF`, which forces the openssl tool to look for a
configuration file in an alternative location (in this case, `~/myCA/caconfig.cnf`).

Now, generate the CA certificate and key with the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -out cacert.pem -outform PEM -days 1825
```

We should be prompted for a passphrase, and see output similar to this:

```
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.................................+++
.................................................................................................+++
writing new private key to '/home/bshumate/myCA/private/cakey.pem'
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
-----
```

**Do not forget the passphrase used with the command above!** We'll need it every time we want to generate and sign a
new server or client certificate!

The process above will create a self-signed certificate using PEM format and RSA public/private key encryption. The
certificate will be valid for _1825_ days. The location, and purpose of the resultant files is as follows:

* `~/myCA/cacert.pem`: CA public **certificate**
* `~/myCA/private/cakey.pem`: CA private key

###### Creating a Self-Signed Server Certificate

Now that we have a Certificate Authority configured, we may use it to sign self-signed certificates. Prior to beginning
the steps below, we may wish to encrypt the certificate's private key with a passphrase. The advantages of encrypting
the key with a passphrase include protection of the certificate in the event it is stolen.

The certificate cannot be used with SSL-enabled applications without entering the passphrase every time the SSL-enabled
application is started. This condition, while being most secure, can present a problem: If the server must be started in
an unattended manner as in the case of a computer restart, then no one will be available to enter the passphrase, and
subsequently the server will not start. One way to eliminate this condition involves a trade-off in security: The key
may be decrypted, to remove the passphrase necessity; thus SSL-enabled applications will start automatically, without a
need for us to enter a passphrase.

To actually generate a self-signed certificate for use with an SSL application, follow this process:

Create the server configuration file, by editing `~/myCA/exampleserver.cnf` with your favorite text editor. Add this
example content:

```conf
#
# exampleserver.cnf
#

[ req ]
prompt                  = no
distinguished_name      = server_distinguished_name
req_extensions          = v3_req

[ server_distinguished_name ]
commonName              = tradeshowhell.com
stateOrProvinceName     = NC
countryName             = US
emailAddress            = root@tradeshowhell.com
organizationName        = My Organization Name
organizationalUnitName  = Subunit of My Large Organization

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints        = CA:FALSE
keyUsage                = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
subjectAltName          = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.0                   = tradeshowhell.com
DNS.1                   = alt.tradeshowhell.com
```

Be sure to change the values under `server_distinguished_name` especially the **commonName** value. The commonName value
must match the host name (i.e. AWS EC2 **Public IPv4 DNS**), or CNAME for the host we wish to use the key for. If the
commonName does not match the intended hostname, then host/certificate mismatch errors will appear in the client
applications of clients attempting to access the server.

Once we've edited the file appropriately, save it as `~/myCA/exampleserver.cnf`. Generate the server certificate, and
key with the following commands:

```bash
export OPENSSL_CONF=~/myCA/exampleserver.cnf
```

The previous command sets an environment variable `OPENSSL_CONF` which forces the `openssl` tool to look for a
configuration file in an alternative location (in this case, `~/myCA/exampleserver.cnf`).

Now generate the certificate, and key:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout tempkey.pem -keyform PEM -out tempreq.pem -outform PEM
```

We should be prompted for a passphrase, and see output similar to this:

```
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
...++++++
...............++++++
writing new private key to 'tempkey.pem'
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:

```

**Don't forget the passphrase!**

Next, we may translate the temporary private key into an unencrypted key by using the following command:

```bash
openssl rsa < tempkey.pem > server_key.pem
```

We should be prompted for the passphrase used above, and see the following output:

```
Enter pass phrase:
writing RSA key
```

If we wish to leave the key encrypted with a passphrase, we will simply rename the temporary key using the following
command, instead of following the step above:

> üìã If we use a server key encrypted with a passphrase, the passphrase will have to be entered each time the server
> application using the encrypted key is started. This means the server application will not start unless someone, or
> something enters the key.

```bash
mv tempkey.pem server_key.pem
```

###### Signing the Self-Signed Server Certificate

Now we need to sign the server certificate with the Certificate Authority (CA) key using these commands:

```bash
export OPENSSL_CONF=~/myCA/caconfig.cnf
```

The previous command modifies the environment variable `OPENSSL_CONF` which forces the `openssl` tool to look for a
configuration file in an alternative location (in this case, `~/myCA/caconfig.cnf` to switch back to the CA
configuration).

Then sign the certificate as follows:

```bash
openssl ca -in tempreq.pem -out server_crt.pem
```

We will be prompted for the passphrase of the CA key as created in the
[Certificate Authority setup](#establishing-a-certificate-authority) section above. Enter this passphrase at the prompt,
and we will then be prompted to confirm the information in the `exampleserver.cnf`, and finally asked to confirm signing
the certificate. Output should be similar to this:

```
Using configuration from /home/bshumate/myCA/caconfig.cnf
Enter pass phrase for /home/bshumate/myCA/private/cakey.pem:
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok
The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows
commonName            :PRINTABLE:'tradeshowhell.com'
stateOrProvinceName   :PRINTABLE:'NC'
countryName           :PRINTABLE:'US'
emailAddress          :IA5STRING:'root@tradeshowhell.com'
organizationName      :PRINTABLE:'Trade Show Hell'
organizationalUnitName:PRINTABLE:'Black Ops'
Certificate is to be certified until Jan  4 21:50:08 2011 GMT (1825 days)
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y


1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
```

Remove the temporary certificate, and key files with the following command:

```bash
rm -f tempkey.pem && rm -f tempreq.pem
```

Hooray! We now have a self-signed server application certificate, and key pair:

1. **server_crt.pem**: Server application certificate file
2. **server_key.pem**: Server application key file

Next, we shall use the certificate for our Jenkins instance.

##### Applying for a Certificate using Certbot

> üìã **Requirements**
> 
> ![Error loading certbot-requirements.png]({{ "/assets/img/certbot-requirements.png" | relative_url}})

###### Install and Setup Certbot

1. **SSH into the server** SSH into the server (i.e. EC2 instance) running our Jenkins instance as a user with sudo 
   privileges.

2. **Install snapd** from command line

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install snapd
    ```

   Either log out and back in again, or restart the EC2 instance, to ensure snap's paths are updated correctly. To test 
   our system, install the [hello-world](https://snapcraft.io/hello-world) snap and make sure it runs correctly:

    ```bash
    $ sudo snap install hello-world
    hello-world 6.4 from Canonical‚úì installed
    $ hello-world
    Hello World!
    ```

3. **Ensure that our version of snapd is up to date** Execute the following instructions on the command line on the 
   machine to ensure that we have the latest version of `snapd`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
    ```

4. **Install Certbot** Run this command on the command line on the machine to install Certbot.

    ```bash
    $ sudo snap install --classic certbot
    ```

5. **Prepare the Certbot command** Execute the following instruction on the command line on the machine to ensure that 
   the `certbot` command can be run.

    ```bash
    $ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
    ```
   
6. **Install Nginx** 

    We would choose Nginx instead of Apache server in this case by installing Nginx using

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
   
   Note that Certbot does not install nginx for us automatically and will through us an error, in the next step, of

    ```
    Could not find a usable 'nginx' binary. Ensure nginx exists, the binary is executable, and your PATH is set
    correctly
    ```
   
7. **Get and Install Certificates** Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit our nginx configuration 
   automatically to serve it, turning on HTTPS access in a single step.

    ```bash
    $ sudo certbot --nginx
    ```

   Enter an email address of ours

    ```
    $ sudo certbot --nginx
    Saving debug log to ...
    Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices)
     (Enter 'c' to cancel): 
    ```

   Next give content to the Terms of Service and decide whether or not to receive promotion emails from Let's Encrypt
   and Certbot

    ```
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Please read the Terms of Service at

    (Y)es/(N)o: Y
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Would you be willing, once your first certificate is successfully issued, to
    share your email address with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a founding
    partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit organization that
    develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work encrypting the web,
    EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.

    (Y)es/(N)o: Y
    ```

   As the last step, provide the domain name sitting in front of our Jenkins instance. Let's give it as
   "jenkins.my-domain.com"

     ```
     Account registered.
     Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or
     space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): jenkins.my-domain.com
     Requesting a certificate for jenkins.my-domain.com
     ```

   If everything works successfully, we shall see the output similar to the one below

     ```
     Successfully received certificate.
     Certificate is saved at: /path/to/server_crt.pem
     Key is saved at:         /path/to/server_key.pem
     This certificate expires on ****-**-**.
     These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
     Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.
    
     Deploying certificate
     Successfully deployed certificate for jenkins.my-domain.com to /some/path/...
     Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://jenkins.my-domain.com

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     ```
   
   Remember the two paths from the command above: "**/path/to/server_crt.pem**" and "**/path/to/server_key.pem**". We
   will need them in order to [load certificate onto Jenkins instance](#convert-ssl-keys-to-pkcs12-format) later. In
   addition, under "/path/to/" there is also the CA certificate "**/path/to/cert.pem**", which we will be using
   
   > üìã **Or**, just get a certificate
   > 
   > If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to the nginx configuration by hand, run this 
   > command instead of the one above:
   >
   > ```
   > $ sudo certbot certonly --nginx
   > ``` 

8. **Test automatic renewal** The Certbot packages on our system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew 
   our certificates automatically before they expire. We will not need to run Certbot again, unless we change our 
   configuration. We can test automatic renewal for our certificates by running this command:

    ```bash
    $ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
    ```
   
   > üìã The command to renew certbot is installed in one of the following locations:
   > 
   > * `/etc/crontab/`
   > * `/etc/cron.*/*`
   > * `systemctl list-timers`

##### Convert SSL keys to PKCS12 format

When [SSL is ready](#generating-ssl-certificates), let's enable secure connection to our Jenkins instance. We would need 
the following files:

1. `server_crt.pem` - The signed certificate
2. `server_key.pem` - The certificate key
3. `cacert.pem` - The CA certificate

**_In the case of [self-signed certificate](#self-signing-a-certificate)_**, under `~/myCA` directory, execute

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out jenkins.p12 \
-passout 'pass:your-strong-password' -inkey server_key.pem \
-in server_crt.pem -certfile cacert.pem -name jenkins.some-domain.com
```

_**In the case of [publicly authorized certificate](#applying-for-a-certificate-using-certbot)**_, run

```bash
sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -out jenkins.p12 -passout 'pass:your-strong-password' -inkey /path/to/server_key.pem -in /path/to/server_crt.pem -certfile /path/to/cert.pem -name jenkins.some-domain.com
```

where `your-strong-password` would be a password of our choice; for example, if you choose "sdfef3qxA" as the password,
put `-passout 'pass:sdfef3qxA'` there. Replace all the occurrences of "your-secrete-password" seen below with
"sdfef3qxA". In adiition, _Replace "jenkins.some-domain.com" with our own CNAME_

The command given above converts SSL certs to intermediate PKCS12 format named **jenkins.p12**.

##### Convert PKCS12 to JKS format

Use the following keytool command to convert the `jenkins.p12` file to JKS format.

```bash
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore jenkins.p12 \
-srcstorepass 'your-secret-password' -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
-srcalias jenkins.some-domain.com -deststoretype JKS \
-destkeystore jenkins.jks -deststorepass 'your-secret-password' \
-destalias jenkins.some-domain.com
```

Replace the following with our own values:

* `-srcstorepass` - [The password we created above](#convert-ssl-keys-to-pkcs12-format)
* `-deststorepass` - A new password we created in this step
* `-srcalias` - The "jenkins.some-domain.com" or our own CNAME we used
  [from the previous step](#convert-ssl-keys-to-pkcs12-format)
* `-destalias` - A destination CNAME, usually the same as `srcalias`

We should, after the command is executed, see a file named **jenkins.jks** in the current location.

##### Add JKS to Jenkins Path

The jenkins.jks file should be saved in a specific location where Jenkins can access it. Let's create a folder for it
and move the jenkins.jks key to that location.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/jenkins
sudo cp jenkins.jks /etc/jenkins/
```

Change the permissions of the keys and folder.

```bash
sudo chown -R jenkins: /etc/jenkins
sudo chmod 700 /etc/jenkins
sudo chmod 600 /etc/jenkins/jenkins.jks
```

> The `jenkins:` used in the first command is a standard Jenkins user that get's created when we install
> [Jenkins package](#long-term-support-release). We are essentially granting permission for that user here so do not
> throw some other "smart" names there or change, please.

##### Modify Jenkins Configuration for SSL

```bash
sudo systemctl edit jenkins
```

```conf
### Anything between here and the comment below will become the new contents of the file

[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=-1"
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_PORT=443"
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_KEYSTORE=/etc/jenkins/jenkins.jks"
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<some strong password>"
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0"

### Lines below this comment will be discarded
```

> The config content above actually gets appended to the end of `systemctl cat jenkins` output, which we can verify to
> make sure that the changes here actually propagates to Jenkins runtime.

> Ignore the comments lines which starts with `### ...`

##### Restart Jenkins

The restart command on Ubuntu C2 instance is

```bash
sudo systemctl restart jenkins.service
```

which would probably fail, however, with the error

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart jenkins.service
Job for jenkins.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status jenkins.service" and "journalctl -xeu jenkins.service" for details.
```

Whenever Jenkins control failes with `systemctl`, we can use its diagnosing command `journalctl` to further investigate:

```bash
journalctl -u jenkins.service -r
```

which probably would show us the follwoing error

```
Caused: java.io.IOException: Failed to bind to /0.0.0.0:443
        at org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector.openAcceptChannel(ServerConnector.java:339)
        at java.base/sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl.bind(ServerSocketChannelImpl.java:227)
        at java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:448)

        at java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)
java.net.SocketException: Permission denied
```

This is because Jetty, which is the Jenkins server, does not have sudo permission to listen on SSL port 443 on startup.
We could verify this by having Jenkins SSL port listen on a non-sudo port such as 8443. To do so, we will run

```bash
sudo systemctl edit jenkins
```

again and change the line from

{% highlight conf %}
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_PORT=443"
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight conf %}
Environment="JENKINS_HTTPS_PORT=8443"
{% endhighlight %}

We will see that Jenkins process started:

```bash
$ ps -aux | grep jenkins
jenkins    46742 45.1 99.1 3245534 89876543 ?      Ssl  06:12   0:29 /usr/bin/java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /usr/share/java/jenkins.war --webroot=/var/cache/jenkins/war --httpPort=-1 --httpsPort=8443 --httpsListenAddress=0.0.0.0 --httpsKeyStore=/etc/jenkins/jenkins.jks --httpsKeyStorePassword=**************
```

We have 2 options.

1. Instruct `sudo systemctl restart jenkins.service` to execute the command above with `sudo`
2. Simply add an inbound rule to AWS EC2 security group to have Jenkins HTTPS listen on a port greater than 1024

We would go with the 2nd option in this post. If we want to open the port for HTTPS and it's not 443, then in addition
to adding HTTPS rule, we could also just add a "Custom TCP" rule for the desired port (i.e. 8443) and it will work.

Now we should be able to access Jenkins over HTTPS with port 8443 at `https://<jenkins-dns/ip>:8443`

#### Post-Installation Setup Wizard

After downloading, installing and running Jenkins on SSL, the post-installation setup wizard begins.

The setup wizard takes us through a few quick "one-off" steps to unlock Jenkins, customize it with plugins and create
the first administrator user through which we can continue accessing Jenkins.

##### Unlocking Jenkins

When we first access a new Jenkins instance, we are asked to unlock it using an automatically-generated password. Browse
to `https://<jenkins-dns/ip>:8443` and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.

![Error loading unlock-jenkins.png]({{ "/assets/img/unlock-jenkins.png" | relative_url}})

As prompted, enter the password found in **/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword** on our EC2 instance path. Use
the following command to display this password:

```bash
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

On the Unlock Jenkins page, paste this password into the **Administrator password** field and click **Continue**.

> This password also serves as the default administrator account's password (with username "admin") if we happen to
> skip the subsequent user-creation step in the setup wizard (So, DO NOT skip this subsequent step).

##### Customizing Jenkins with Plugins

After [unlocking Jenkins](#unlocking-jenkins), the Customize Jenkins page appears. Here we can install any number of
useful plugins as part of our initial setup.

Click one of the two options shown:

* **Install suggested plugins** - to install the recommended set of plugins, which are based on most common use cases.
* **Select plugins to install** - to choose which set of plugins to initially install. When we first access the plugin
  selection page, the suggested plugins are selected by default.

> If we are not sure what plugins we need, choose **Install suggested plugins**. We can install (or remove)
> additional Jenkins plugins at a later point in time via the
> [Manage Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/) > [Manage Plugins page in Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/).

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and our chosen set of Jenkins plugins being
installed. This process may take a few minutes.

##### Creating the First Administrator User

![Error loading create-admin-user.png]({{ "/assets/img/create-admin-user.png" | relative_url}})

Finally, after [customizing Jenkins with plugins](#customizing-jenkins-with-plugins), Jenkins asks us to create our
first administrator user.

1. When the **Create First Admin User** page appears, specify the details for our administrator user in the respective
   fields and click **Save and Finish**.
2. When the **Jenkins is ready** page appears, click **Start using Jenkins**.
    - This page may indicate **Jenkins is almost ready!** instead and if so, click **Restart**.
    - If the page does not automatically refresh after a minute, use our web browser to refresh the page manually.
3. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user we just created and we are ready to start using
   Jenkins!


Jenkins Reference Guide
-----------------------

### Jenkins controller

The Jenkins controller is the Jenkins service itself and is where Jenkins is installed. It is a webserver that also acts 
as a "brain" for deciding how, when and where to run tasks. Management tasks (configuration, authorization, and 
authentication) are executed on the controller, which serves HTTP requests. Files written when a Pipeline executes are 
written to the filesystem on the controller unless they are off-loaded to an artifact repository such as Nexus or 
Artifactory.

### Nodes

Nodes are the "machines" on which build agents run. Jenkins monitors each attached node for disk space, free temp space, 
free swap, clock time/sync and response time. A node is taken offline if any of these values go outside the configured 
threshold.

The Jenkins controller itself runs on a special built-in node. It is possible to run agents and executors on this 
built-in node although this can degrade performance, reduce scalability of the Jenkins instance, and create serious 
security problems and is strongly discouraged, especially for production environments.

### Agents

Agents manage the task execution on behalf of the Jenkins controller by using [executors](#executors). An agent is 
actually a small (170KB single jar) Java client process that connects to a Jenkins controller and is assumed to be 
unreliable. An agent can use any operating system that supports Java. Tools required for builds and tests are installed 
on the node where the agent runs; they can be installed directly or in a container (Docker or Kubernetes). Each agent is 
effectively a process with its own PID (Process Identifier) on the host machine.

In practice, nodes and agents are essentially the same but it is good to remember that they are conceptually distinct.

#### Creating Agents

The Jenkins architecture is designed for distributed build environments. It allows us to use different environments for
each build project balancing the workload among multiple agents running jobs in parallel.

The **Jenkins controller** is the original node in the Jenkins installation. The Jenkins controller administers the
**Jenkins agents** and orchestrates their work, including scheduling jobs on agents and monitoring agents. Agents may be
connected to the Jenkins controller using either local or cloud computers.

The agents require a Java installation and a network connection to the Jenkins controller and can be launched in
physical machines, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and with Docker images.


### Executors

An executor is a slot for execution of tasks; effectively, _it is a thread in the agent_. The number of executors on a 
node defines the number of concurrent tasks that can be executed on that node at one time. In other words, this 
determines the number of concurrent Pipeline stages that can execute on that node at one time.

The proper number of executors per build node must be determined based on the resources available on the node and the 
resources required for the workload. When determining how many executors to run on a node, consider CPU and memory 
requirements as well as the amount of I/O and network activity:

* One executor per node is the safest configuration.
* One executor per CPU core may work well if the tasks being run are small.
* Monitor I/O performance, CPU load, memory usage, and I/O throughput carefully when running multiple executors on a
  node.

##### Distributed Builds Architecture



### How to Configure a Jenkins Pipeline

#### Let's Define 2 Jenkins Jobs

Suppose we need 2 jobs, first of which runs some "gatekeeper" tests and second of which deploys the software artifact
to a dev/prod environment.

##### Converting Conditional Build Steps to Jenkins Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline enables users to implement their pipeline as code. Pipeline code can be written directly in the Jenkins
Web UI or in any text editor. It is a full-featured programming language, which gives users access to much broader set
of conditional statements without the restrictions of UI-based programming.

So, taking our case as an example, the Pipeline looks like the following:

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        choice(
            choices: ['dev' , 'prod'],
            description: 'The environment artifact will be deployed into',
            name: 'DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT')
    }

    stages {
        stage ('Gatekeeper Tests') {
            steps {
                build job: 'external-gatekeeper-jenkins-job',
                parameters: [
                    [
                        $class: 'StringParameterValue',
                        name: 'num_test_threads',
                        value: "${params.num_test_threads}"
                    ],
                    [
                        $class: 'BooleanParameterValue',
                        name: 'dry_run',
                        value: "${params.dry_run}"
                    ]
                ]
                echo "Gatekeeper tests finished!"
            }
        }
        stage ('Dev Deployment') {
            when {
                expression { params.DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT == 'dev' }
            }
            steps {
                build job: 'dev-deployment-jenkins-job',
                parameters: ...
            }
        }
        stage ('Prod Deployment') {
            when {
                expression { params.DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT == 'dev' }
            }
                build job: 'prod-deployment-jenkins-job',
                parameters: ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The parameters such as `num_test_threads` as defined through "This project is parameterized" config panel:

![Error loading jenkins-parameter-config.png]({{ "/assets/img/jenkins-parameter-config.png" | relative_url}})

> üìã Note that `num_test_threads` will
> be added to both this pipeline and the `external-gatekeeper-jenkins-job` in the same way presente above
>
> All available parameter types (`$class`) can be found at https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/model/ParameterValue.html

If you have configured your pipeline (such as `dev-deployment-jenkins-job`) to accept parameters when it is built -
**Build with Parameters** - they are accessible as Groovy variables inside params. They are also accessible as
environment variables. For example: Using `isFoo` parameter defined as a boolean parameter (checkbox in the UI):

```
node {
sh "isFoo is ${params.isFoo}"
sh 'isFoo is ' + params.isFoo
if (params.isFoo) {
    // do something
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Echo Off in Jenkins Console Output

By default, Jenkins launches Execute Shell script with `set -x`. This causes all commands to be echoed. We can type
`set +x` before any command to temporary override that behavior. Of course you will need `set -x` to start showing them
again.

You can override this behaviour for the whole script by putting the following at the top of the build step:

```bash
#!/bin/bash +x
```


Integrate Jenkins with GitHub through Webhooks
----------------------------------------------

This approach  for most enterprise GitHub repos (i.e. private repos).

* CI/CD logics doesn't shown
