This approach  for most enterprise GitHub repos (i.e. private repos).

* CI/CD logics doesn't shown 

### Configuring GitHub

**Step 1**: go to your GitHub repository and click on "**Settings**".

**Step 3**: In the "**Payload URL**" field, paste your Jenkins environment URL. At the end of this URL add **/github-webhook/**. In the "Content type" select: "application/json" and leave the "Secret" field empty.

**Step 4**: In the page "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?" choose "_Let me select individual
events._" Then, check "Pull Requests" and "Pushes". At the end of this option, make sure that the "Active" option is 
checked and click on "**Add webhook**".

We're done with the configuration on GitHubâ€™s side! Now let's move on to Jenkins.

### Configuring Jenkins

**Step 5**: In Jenkins, click on "**New Item**" to create a new project.

**Step 9**: Click on the "**Build Triggers**" tab and then on the "_GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling_". Or,
choose the trigger of your choice.

That's it! Our GitHub repository has integrated with our Jenkins project. With this Jenkins GitHub integration, we can
now use any file found in the GitHub repository and trigger the Jenkins job to run with every code commit.
