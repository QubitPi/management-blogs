A Knowledge Graph is a reusable data layer that is used to answer sophisticated queries across multiple data silos. With 
contextualized data displayed and organized in the form of tables and graphs, they achieve pinnacle connectivity. They
can quickly accept new information, classifications, and criteria since they were designed to capture the ever-changing 
nature of the data. There are different libraries for performing knowledge graphs in Python. Let's check out a few of
them.

Python Packages for Knowledge Graphs
------------------------------------

### Pykg2vec

[Pykg2vec](https://github.com/Sujit-O/pykg2vec) is a Python package that implements knowledge graph embedding algorithms 
and flexible embedding pipeline building elements. This library seeks to assist academics and programmers in fast
testing algorithms with their knowledge base, or adapting the package for their algorithms using modular blocks.

Pykg2vec was built using TensorFlow, but because more authors utilized Pytorch to create their KGE models, it was
switched with Pytorch. The TF version is still available in the tf2-master branch. In addition to the primary model 
training procedure, pykg2vec uses multi-processing to generate mini-batches and conduct an assessment to minimize the 
overall completion time.

#### Features

* Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
* Inspection techniques for the learned embeddings
* Support cutting-edge KGE model variants as well as evaluation datasets
* Allow for the export of learned embeddings in TSV or Pandas-compatible formats
* KPI overview visualization depending on TSNE (mean rank, hit ratio) in multiple formats

#### Benefits

* Interactive visualizations
* Personalized datasets

### PyKEEN

[PyKEEN (Python Knowledge Embeddings)](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen) is a Python library that builds and evaluates 
knowledge graphs and embedding models. In PyKEEN 1.0, we can estimate the aggregation measures directly for all frequent 
rank categories. Such as mean, optimistic, and pessimistic, allowing comparison of their differences.

It can identify instances where the model precisely forecasts identical scores for various triples, which is typically 
undesirable behavior. The PyTorch module is used to implement it for Python 3.7+. It includes a set of comprehensive 
testing processes performed with PyTest and Tox. You can execute in Travis-continuous CI's integration environment.

#### Features

* Training Approaches: LCWA and sLCWA
* Uniform and Bernoulli negative samplers
* Optimization of hyper-parameters using optuna
* Early stopping
* Evaluation metrics: adjusted mean rank, mean rank, ROC-AUC score

#### Benefits

* It is the only library that uses automatic memory optimization to verify that memory limits are not surpassed during 
  testing and training.
* Users can replicate and maintain graphs due to several community-driven tools.

### AmpliGraph

Knowledge graph embeddings can be used for various tasks, including knowledge graph completion, information retrieval,
and link-based categorization, to name a few. [AmpliGraph](https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph/) is the first 
open-source toolkit to democratize graph representation learning, allowing for **discovering whole new knowledge from 
existing graphs**.

The AmpliGraph package includes machine learning models that can generate knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs), low-level 
vector representations of the items, and relationships that make up a knowledge graph.

These models use low-dimensional vectors to encode nodes and relationships of a graph. As a result, subsequent systems
that depend on those graphs, such as question-answering software, improve efficiency.

It reduces the entry barriers for knowledge graph embeddings, making such models available to even the most unskilled
users and establishing a community of professionals who can benefit from the freeware API for learning on knowledge
graphs.

#### Features

* [Customization] You can enhance AmpliGraph-based estimators to create your custom knowledge graph embeddings framework.
* [Support] It can run on both CPUs and GPUs to accelerate the training procedure.
* [Less Code] Its APIs cut down on the code needed to anticipate code in knowledge graphs.

#### Benefits

* Open Source API
* It can **predict the missing relationships between graphs**.
* The curation of graphs produced automatically from text, which are typically messy and imprecise, is also considerably 
  improved by link prediction.

### LibKGE

[LibKGE](https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge)'s primary purpose is to promote repeatable study into KGE models and training 
techniques. The training approach and hyperparameters selected significantly impact simulation results than the model 
class alone.

The goal of LibKGE is to provide simple training, hyperparameter optimization, and assessment procedures that can be
used with any model. Every possible knob or heuristic in the platform is available explicitly through well-documented 
configuration files. The most common KGE models are included in LibKGE, and you can introduce new models. A thorough 
logging mechanism and equipment facilitate in-depth examination.

#### Features

* Early termination
* Checkpointing
* High parallelism potential
* You can pause and restart at any moment
* With or without mutual interactions, all models can be employed.
* Automated Memory management for huge batch sizes

#### Benefits

* LIBKGE is well-structured. Individual modules can be combined and matched, and additional components can be incorporated
  quickly.
* The present configuration of the test is saved alongside the model to increase evaluation and consistency.
* During tests, LIBKGE logs a lot of data and keeps track of performance measures like runtime, memory utilization, 
  training attrition, and evaluation methods.
