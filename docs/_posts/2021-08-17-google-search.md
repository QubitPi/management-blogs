## Overview 
  
Google is not searching the internet: it is searching an index. Google has huge server farms which are constantly
scanning and indexing the internet. This process takes a lot of time, just like the search of your unindexed hard drive.
In Windows 7, there is an option to index your hard drives. This process takes some time at first but once it is up and
running the results of a search will be instantaneous.

> Google: Our mission is to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.
