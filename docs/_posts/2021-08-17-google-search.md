## Overview 
  
Google is not searching the internet: it is searching an index. Google has huge server farms which are constantly
scanning and indexing the internet. This process takes a lot of time, just like the search of your unindexed hard drive.
In Windows 7, there is an option to index your hard drives. This process takes some time at first but once it is up and
running the results of a search will be instantaneous.

> Google: Our mission is to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

### Google's Approach to Search

Deliver the most relevant and reliable information available

### How Search Works

* **Finding Information by Crawling** - Most of our Search index is built through the work of software known as
  crawlers. These automatically visit publicly accessible webpages and follow links on those pages, much like you would
  if you were browsing content on the web. They go from page to page and store information about what they find on these
  pages and other publicly-accessible content in Google's Search index.
