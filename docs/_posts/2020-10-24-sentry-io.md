## Application Monitoring

### Customer Experience is Everything

For today's modern digital business, delivering superior performance and a great user experience at scale is just as
important as new functionality and features. This requires broad and deep application monitoring across every customer
journey.

With full stack monitoring powered by analytics, Application Monitoring helps teams understand how technology
performance impacts the business and its customers. Eliminating blind-spots and pinpointing problems– from front-end
apps to back-end business processes—and spanning modern networks and cloud services, CA solutions provide the rich
insights needed to power digital business.

### What is Application Monitoring?

Application monitoring is the process to ensure that software applications, systems and networks maintain the levels of
performance needed to support business outcomes. This process is used by DevOps practitioners to measure and evaluate
the performance of software application elements (from application to infrastructure) and as the primary means to
detect, triage and remediate performance issues. As application complexity increases, tools in this category also employ
analytics to reduce false-alarms, pinpoint anomalies and predict problems.

[sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) is an Enterprise Application Monitoring that offers

* **very smooth deploy experience, and**
* **easy integration into your application**

## Deploy [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)

### Option 1 - [On-Premis](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/)

For the sake of simplicity, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) has chosen to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for this, along with a bash-based install and upgrade script.

The following deploy steps applies to remote server and local dev machines:

1. Download the [latest release of the on-premise repository](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases/latest)
2. Extract the `.tar.gz` to a location where everything will be installed at
3. (Optional) [Configure installation](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/#configuration)
4. Run the `./install.sh` inside the repository. You will be asked for admin login info, including password during this
   process.
   
   > ⚠️ It is requires to allocate at least 4GB of memory for docker to use if we are trying to install it on our local
   > machine:
   
   ![sentry-io-install-memory.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-install-memory.png" | relative_url}})

5. Start sentry.io application using `docker-compose up -d`, which will spin up 29 containers.

Now we could go to dashboard at [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000), which we should be able to see something
like the following:

![sentry-io-login.png is missing]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-login.png" | relative_url}})
![sentry-io-login.png is missing]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-dashboard.png" | relative_url}})

### Option 2 - [Cloud](https://sentry.io/auth/login/)

## Resource Consumption

In order to make sure a monitoring service, such as [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/), does not impact other application's
performances too much, [cAdvisor](./2020-08-19-28-docker.md). Among all 30 containers shown below, 29 are
sentry.io-related containers and one extra for cAdvisor monitorning container: 

### Case - Idle

When nothing gettings sent from application to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) monitoring, the resource consumption
is recorded as follows: (The docker was given 2 CPU's, which was why we see "Core 0" and "Core 1" in the diagram below)

![sentry-io-monitoring-idle.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-monitoring-idle.png" | relative_url}})

### Case - Under Load

Under the case of load testing, in which we have 10 process each of which sends sanity GET requests in an infinite loop,
the resource usage becomes the following:

![sentry-io-monitoring-under-load.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-monitoring-under-load.png" | relative_url}})

## Integrate [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) into Spring Boot

As we will see, integrating [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) into an existing application, such as Spring Boot
microservice, will be just an easy 3-step:

### 1 - Create Project

![sentry-io-create-project-1.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-create-project-1.png" | relative_url}})
![sentry-io-create-project-2.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-create-project-2.png" | relative_url}})

### 2 - Turn on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) Service in Spring Boot

![sentry-io-turn-on-service.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-turn-on-service.png" | relative_url}})

### 3 - Start Using it

![sentry-io-use-1.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-use-1.png" | relative_url}})
![sentry-io-use-2.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/sentry-io-use-2.png" | relative_url}})
