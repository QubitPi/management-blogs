ArangoDB lets you apply analytics and machine learning to graph data at scale

<!--more-->

ArangoDB's Graph Analytics and GraphML capabilities provide various solutions in data science and data analytics.
Multiple data science personas within the engineering space can make use of ArangoDB's set of tools and technologies
that enable analytics and machine learning on graph data.

ArangoDB, as the foundation for GraphML, comes with the following key features:

* **Scalable**: designed to support true scalability with high performance for enterprise use cases.
* **Simple Ingestion**: easy integration in existing data infrastructure with connectors to all leading data processing
  and data ecosystems.
* **Open Source**: extensibility and community.
* **NLP Support**: built-in text processing, search, and similarity ranking.

Graph Query v.s. Graph Analytics v.s Graph Machine Learning (GraphML)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Graph Query

When running a query with AQL on a graph, the query goes from a vertex to an edge, and then the edge indicates what the 
next connected vertex will be. Graph queries can answer questions like _Who can introduce me to person X?_

### Graph Analytics

Graph analytics or graph algorithms is what you run on a graph if you want to know aggregate information about your
graph, while analyzing the entire graph. Graph analytics can answer questions like _Who are the most connected persons?_

![Error arango-graph-analytics.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-graph-analytics.png" | relative_url}})

Graph Analytics is applicable in various fields such as marketing, fraud detection, supply chain, product
recommendations, drug development, law enforcement, and cybersecurity. It uses an unsupervised learning method that 
performs analytical processing directly on graphs stored in ArangoDB. The
[Distributed Iterative Graph Processing (Pregel)](#distributed-iterative-graph-processing-pregel) is intended to help
you gain analytical insights in your data, without having to use external processing systems.

ArangoDB includes the following graph algorithms:

* [Page Rank](#pagerank): used for ranking documents in a graph search/traversal.
* [Single-Source Shortest Path](#single-source-shortest-path): calculates the shortest path length between the source
  and all other vertices. For example, _How to get from a to b?_
* [Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS)](#hyperlink-induced-topic-search-hits): a link analysis algorithm that rates
  web pages.
* [Vertex Centrality](#vertex-centrality): identifies the most important nodes in a graph. For example,
  _Who are the influencers in a social network?_
* [Community Detection](#community-detection): identifies distinct subgroups within a community structure.

### GraphML

When applying machine learning on a graph, you can predict connections, get better product recommendations, and also 
classify vertices, edges, and graphs. GraphML can answer questions like:

* _Is there a connection between person X and person Y?_
* _Will a customer churn?_
* _Is this particular transaction Anomalous?_

![Error arango-graph-ml.png!]({{ "/assets/img/arango-graph-ml.png" | relative_url}})

GraphML capabilities of using more data outperform conventional deep learning methods and solve high-computational 
complexity graph problems, such as:

* Drug discovery, repurposing, and predicting adverse effects.
* Personalized product/service recommendation.
* Supply chain and logistics.

With GraphML, you can also predict relationships and structures, such as:

* Predict molecules for treating diseases (precision medicine).
* Predict fraudulent behavior, credit risk, purchase of product or services.
* Predict relationships among customers, accounts.

ArangoDB uses well-known GraphML frameworks like [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) and
[PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and connects to these external machine learning 
libraries. When coupled to ArangoDB, you are essentially integrating them with your graph dataset.

Distributed Iterative Graph Processing (Pregel)
-----------------------------------------------

Pregel enables you to do online analytical processing directly on graphs stored in ArangoDB.

Distributed graph processing enables you to do online analytical processing directly on graphs stored in ArangoDB. This
is intended to help you gain analytical insights on your data, without having to use external processing systems.
Examples of algorithms to execute include

* [PageRank](#pagerank)
* [Vertex Centrality](#vertex-centrality)
* Vertex Closeness
* [Connected Components](#connected-components)
* [Community Detection](#community-detection)

### Pregel Community Detection Tutorial

> ðŸ“‹ This tutorial is tailored to Mac OS X. 

Community structures are quite common in real networks. For example, social networks include community groups (the
origin of the term, in fact) based on common locations, hobbies, occupation, etc. Finding an underlying community
structure in a network, if it exists, is important for a number of reasons. Communities allow us to create a large scale 
map of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network which makes its study easier.

#### Creating the ArangoDB Graph

The data we are going to use is the Pokec social network available from the
[Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-pokec.html). Pokec is the most popular on-line 
social network in Slovakia, we will use it to detect communities in the graph. We assume that as a social network it 
contains an underlying community structure, which we can discover through one of our algorithms.

As a first step, you should [install and start the ArangoDB cluster](https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/macosx/). 

Next we will [log into Arango shell](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/12435#issuecomment-704856496):

{% highlight bash %}
$ /Applications/ArangoDB3-CLI.app/Contents/Resources/arangosh
Please specify a password:
{% endhighlight %}

Simply hit "Enter" and you will be logged in as root:

{% highlight bash %}
$ /Applications/ArangoDB3-CLI.app/Contents/Resources/arangosh
Please specify a password:

                                       _

arangosh (ArangoDB 3.7.11 [darwin] 64bit, using build tags/v3.7.11-0-g5ca39c161b, VPack 0.1.33, RocksDB 6.8.0, ICU 64.2, V8 7.9.317, OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021)

Command-line history will be persisted when the shell is exited. You can use `--console.history false` to turn this off
Connected to ArangoDB 'http+tcp://127.0.0.1:8529, version: 3.7.11 [SINGLE, server], database: '_system', username: 'root'

Type 'tutorial' for a tutorial or 'help' to see common examples
127.0.0.1:8529@_system>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
arangosh> require("@arangodb").db._name();
_system
{% endhighlight %}

The next step is to create the collections and the arangodb named "graph". In the arangosh prompt you can paste in the 
following commands:

{% highlight javascript %}
var graph_module = require("@arangodb/general-graph");

var graph = graph_module._create("pokec");
db._create("profiles", {numberOfShards: 4});

graph._addVertexCollection("profiles");
db._createEdgeCollection("relations", {

numberOfShards: 4,
replicationFactor: 1,
shardKeys:["vertex"],
distributeShardsLike:"profiles"});

var rel = graph_module._relation("relations", ["profiles"], ["profiles"]);

graph._extendEdgeDefinitions(rel);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Preparing and importing the graph data

Now that we have the data ready for import we can import into our arangodb instance. Adjust the
`--server.endpoint` option as necessary

{% highlight bash %}
$ /Applications/ArangoDB3-CLI.app/Contents/Resources/arangoimp -c none --server.endpoint http+tcp://127.0.0.1:8529  --type tsv --collection relations --file soc-pokec-relationships-arangodb.txt
