## Overview

Rancher is a container management platform built for organizations that deploy containers in production.

Rancher users have the choice of creating Kubernetes clusters with Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) or cloud Kubernetes
services, such as GKE, AKS, and EKS.

### Meet IT Requirements

Rancher supports centralized authentication, access control, and monitoring for all Kubernetes clusters under its
control. For example, you can:

* Use your Active Directory credentials to access Kubernetes clusters hosted by cloud vendors, such as GKE.
* Setup and enforce access control and security policies across all users, groups, projects, clusters, and clouds.
* View the health and capacity of your Kubernetes clusters from a single-pane-of-glass.

### Empower DevOps Teams

Rancher provides an intuitive user interface for DevOps engineers to manage their application workload. Rancher is
certified with a wide selection of cloud native ecosystem products, including, for example, security tools, monitoring
systems, container registries, and storage and networking drivers.

The following figure illustrates the role Rancher plays in IT and DevOps organizations. _Each team deploys their
applications on the public or private clouds they choose. IT administrators gain visibility and enforce policies across
all users, clusters, and clouds.

### Rancher API Server

The Rancher API server is built on top of an embedded Kubernetes API server and an [etcd database](https://etcd.io/). It
implements the following functionalities:

#### Authorization and Role-Based Access Control

* **User management**: The Rancher API server
  [manages user identities](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/authentication/) that correspond to
  external authentication providers like Active Directory or GitHub, in addition to local users.
* **Authorization**: The Rancher API server manages
  [access control](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/) and
  [security](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/pod-security-policies/) policies.
  
#### Working with Kubernetes

* **Provisioning Kubernetes clusters**: The Rancher API server can
  [provision Kubernetes](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/) on existing nodes, or perform
  [Kubernetes upgrades](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-admin/upgrading-kubernetes).
* **Catalog management**: Rancher provides the ability to use a
  [catalog of Helm charts](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/catalog/) that make it easy to repeatedly deploy
  applications.
* **Managing projects**: **A project is a group of multiple namespaces and access control policies within a cluster**. A
  project is a Rancher concept, not a Kubernetes concept, which allows you to manage multiple namespaces as a group and
  perform Kubernetes operations in them. The Rancher UI provides features for
  [project administration](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/project-admin/) and
  [for managing applications within projects](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/k8s-in-rancher/).
* **Pipelines**: Setting up a [pipeline](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/project-admin/pipelines/) can help
  developers deliver new software as quickly and efficiently as possible. Within Rancher, you can configure pipelines
  for each of your Rancher projects.
* **Istio**: Our integration with Istio is designed so that a Rancher operator, such as an administrator or cluster
  owner, can deliver Istio to developers. Then developers can use Istio to enforce security policies, troubleshoot
  problems, or manage traffic for green/blue deployments, canary deployments, or A/B testing.

#### Working with Cloud Infrastructure

* **Tracking nodes**: The Rancher API server tracks identities of all the nodes in all clusters.
* **Setting up infrastructure**: When configured to use a cloud provider, Rancher can dynamically provision new nodes
  and persistent storage in the cloud.

#### Cluster Visibility

* **Logging**: Rancher can integrate with a variety of popular logging services and tools that exist outside of your
  Kubernetes clusters.
* **Monitoring**: Using Rancher, you can monitor the state and processes of your cluster nodes, Kubernetes components,
  and software deployments through integration with Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution.
* **Alerting**: To keep your clusters and applications healthy and driving your organizational productivity forward, you
  need to stay informed of events occurring in your clusters and projects, both planned and unplanned.

## Architecture

The figure depicts a Rancher Server installation that manages two downstream Kubernetes clusters: one created by
[RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/) and  another created by
[Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/).
