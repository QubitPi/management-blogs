The mechanics of programming usually follow a fairly simple routine of editing source files, compiling the source into
an executable form, and debugging the result. Although transforming the source into an executable is considered routine,
if done incorrectly a programmer can waste immense amounts of time tracking down the problem. For example, most
developers have experienced the frustration of modifying a function and running the new code only to find that their
change did not fix the bug. The "make" program is intended to automate the mundane aspects of transforming source code
into an executable. The advantages of "make" over scripts is that you can specify the relationships between the elements
of your program to "make", and it knows through these relationships and timestamps exactly what steps need to be redone
to produce the desired program each time. Using this information, "make" can also optimize the build process avoiding 
unnecessary steps.

`make` defines a language for describing the relationships between source code, intermediate files, and executables. It 
also provides features to manage alternate configurations, implement reusable libraries of specifications, and
parameterize processes with user-defined macros. In short, make can be considered the center of the development process
by providing a roadmap of an application's components and how they fit together.

# Basic Concepts

## How to Write a Simple Makefile

The specification that make uses is generally saved in a file named Makefile. To build the program execute `make` by

```bash
$ make
```

This will cause the `make` program to read the Makefile and build the first target it finds there. If a target is 
included as a command-line argument, that target is updated. If no command-line targets are given, then the first target
in the file is used, called the **default goal**. For example,

```latex
build:
	xelatex document.tex
	xelatex document.tex

clean:
	rm *.aux *.log *.tdo *.toc *.out

clean-all:
	make clean
	rm document.pdf
```

Running `make` compiles the "document.tex" twice while `make clean` removes tex auxiliary files, such as toc file

Typically the default goal in most Makefile is to build a program. This usually involves many steps. Often the source 
code for the program is incomplete and the source must be generated using utilities such as `flex` or `bison`. Next the source is compiled into binary object files (`.o` files for C/C++, `.class` files for Java, etc.). Then, for C/C++,
the object files are bound together by a linker (usually invoked through the compiler, `gcc`) to form an executable
program.

Modifying any of the source files and reinvoking `make` will cause some, but usually not all, of these commands to be 
repeated so the source code changes are properly incorporated into the executable. The specification file, or
Makefile, describes the relationship between the source, intermediate, and executable program files so that `make` can 
perform the minimum amount of work necessary to update the executable.

The principle value of "make" comes from its ability to perform the complex series of commands necessary to build an 
application and to optimize these operations when possible to reduce the time taken by the edit-compile-debug cycle. 
Furthermore, **"make" is flexible enough to be used anywhere one kind of file depends on another from traditional
programming in C/C++ to Java, TEX, database management, and more**.

### Targets and Prerequisites

A Makefile contains a set of rules used to build an application. The first rule seen by make is used as the **default 
rule**. A **rule** consists of three parts:

1. the target,
2. its prerequisites, and
3. the command(s) to perform

```makefile
target: prereq1 prereq2
        commands
```

The **target** is the file or thing that must be made. The **prerequisites** or **dependents** are those files that must 
exist before the target can be successfully created. And the **commands** are those shell commands that will create the 
target from the prerequisites.

Here is a rule for compiling a C file, `foo.c`, into an object file, `foo.o`:

```makefile
foo.o: foo.c foo.h
    gcc -c foo.c
```

> 📋 The command script usually appears 
>on the following lines and is preceded by a tab character.

When make is asked to evaluate a rule, it begins by finding the files indicated by the prerequisites and target. If any
of the prerequisites has an associated rule, make attempts to update those first. Next, the target file is considered.
If any prerequisite is newer than the target, the target is remade by executing the commands. Each com- mand line is 
passed to the shell and is executed in its own subshell. If any of the commands generates an error, the building of the 
target is terminated and make exits. One file is considered newer than another if it has been modified more recently.

#### Example

> 📋 This example assumes that:
>
> 1. All the project source code and the make description file are stored in a single directory.
> 2. The "make" description file is called "makefile", "Makefile", or "GNUMakefile".
> 3. The Makefile resides in the user’s current directory when executing the make command.

Here is a program to count the number of occurrences of the words "fee", "fie", "foe", and "fum" in its input. It uses a 
flex scanner driven by a simple main:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern int fee_count, fie_count, foe_count, fum_count;
extern int yylex( void );

int main( int argc, char ** argv )
{
    yylex();
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", fee_count, fie_count, foe_count, fum_count);
    exit( 0 );
}
```

The scanner is very simple:

```
    int fee_count = 0;
    int fie_count = 0;
    int foe_count = 0;
    int fum_count = 0;

%%
fee     fee_count++;
fie     fie_count++;
foe     foe_count++;
fum     fum_count++;
```

The Makefile for this program is also quite simple:

```makefile
count_words: count_words.o lexer.o -lfl
    gcc count_words.o lexer.o -lfl -o count_words

count_words.o: count_words.c
    gcc -c count_words.c

lexer.o: lexer.c
    gcc -c lexer.c

lexer.c: lexer.l
    flex -t lexer.l > lexer.c
```

When this Makefile is executed for the first time, we see:

```bash
$ make
gcc -c count_words.c
flex -t lexer.l > lexer.c
gcc -c lexer.c
gcc count_words.o lexer.o -lfl -o count_words
```

> 📋 Makefile adopts top-down style for
> defining targets, i.e. the most general form of target is specified first and the details are left for later. The make
> program supports this style in many ways. 

How did make decide what to do? Let's go over the previous execution in more detail to find out.

First make notices that the command line contains no targets so it decides to make the default goal, `count_words`. It 
checks for prerequisites and sees three: `count_words.o`, `lexer.o`, and `-lfl`. "make" now considers how to build 
`count_words.o` and sees a rule for it. Again, it checks the prerequisites, notices that **`count_words.c` has no rules
but that the file exists, so make executes the commands to transform count_words.c into count_words.o by executing the command**:

```bash
gcc -c count_words.c
```

> 📋 This "chaining" of targets to 
> prerequisites to targets to prerequisites is typical of how "make" analyzes a Makefile to decide the commands to be 
> performed.

The next prerequisite "make" considers is `lexer.o`. Again the chain of rules leads to `lexer.c` but this time the file
does not exist. "make" finds the rule for generating `lexer.c` from `lexer.l` so it runs the "flex" program. Now that `lexer.c` exists it can run the gcc command.

Finally, make examines `-lfl`. The `-l` option to gcc indicates a system library that must be linked into the
application. The actual library name indicated by `fl` is `libfl.a`. GNU make includes special support for this syntax. 
When a prerequisite of the form `-l<NAME>` is seen, make searches for a file of the form `libNAME.so`; if no match is 
found, it then searches for `libNAME.a`. Here make finds `/usr/lib/libfl.a` and proceeds with the final action, linking.

##### Minimizing Rebuilds

When we run our program, we discover that aside from printing fees, fies, foes, and fums, it also prints text from the 
input file. This is not what we want. The problem is that we have forgotten some rules in our lexical analyzer and
"flex" is passing this unrecognized text to its output. To solve this problem we simply add an "any character" rule and a
newline rule:

```
    int fee_count = 0;
    int fie_count = 0;
    int foe_count = 0; 
    int fum_count = 0;

%%
fee fee_count++;
fie fie_count++;
foe foe_count++;
fum fum_count++;
.
\n
```

After editing this file we need to rebuild the application to test our fix:

```bash
$ make
flex -t lexer.l > lexer.c
gcc -c lexer.c
gcc count_words.o lexer.o -lfl -ocount_words
```

Notice this time the file `count_words.c` was not recompiled. When make analyzed the rule, it discovered that 
**`count_words.o` existed and was newer than its prerequisite `count_words.c` so no action was necessary to bring the
file up to date**. While analyzing lexer.c, however, "make" saw that the prerequisite `lexer.l` was newer than its
target `lexer.c` so make must update `lexer.c`. This, in turn, caused the update of `lexer.o` and then `count_words`.
Now our word counting program is fixed:

```bash
$ count_words < lexer.l
3 3 3 3
```

If the target you specify is already up to date, "make" will say so and immediately exit, doing nothing else:

```bash
$ make lexer.c
make: `lexer.c' is up to date.
```

If you specify a target that is not in the Makefile and for which there is no [implicit rule](#rules), `make` will respond with:

```bash
$ make non-existent-target
make: *** No rule to make target `non-existent-target'. Stop.
```

"make" has many command-line options. One of the most useful is **`--just-print`** (or `-n`) which tells make to display 
the commands it would execute for a particular target without actually executing them. This is particularly valuable
while writing Makefile. It is also possible to set almost any Makefile variable on the command line to override the 
default value or the value set in the Makefile.

### Basic Makefile Syntax

Makefiles are usually structured top-down so that the most general target, often called **all**, is updated by default. 
More and more detailed targets follow with targets for program maintenance, such as a **clean target** to delete
unwanted temporary files, coming last. As you can guess from these target names, targets do not have to be actual files, 
any name will do.

In the [example](#example) above we saw a simplified form of a rule. The more complete (but still not quite complete)
form of a rule is:

```makefile
target1 target2 target3 : prerequisite1 prerequisite2
    command1
    command2
    command3
```

One or more targets appear to the left of the colon and zero or more prerequisites can appear to the right of the colon. If no prerequisites are listed to the right, then only the target(s) that do not exist are updated. The set of commands executed to update a target are sometimes called the **command script**, but most often just the **commands**.

> 📋 **Each command must begin with a tab character**. This (obscure) syntax tells "make" that the characters that
> follow the tab are to be passed to a sub-shell for execution. If you accidentally insert a tab as the first character
> of a non-command line, "make" will interpret the following text as a command under most circumstances. If you're lucky 
> and your errant tab character is recognized as a syntax error you will receive the message:
>
> ```bash
> $ make
> Makefile:6: *** commands commence before first target. Stop.
> ```

The comment character for make is the hash or pound sign, `#`. All text from the pound sign to the end of line is
ignored. Comments can be indented and leading whitespace is ignored. The comment character `#` does not introduce a make 
comment in the text of commands. The entire line, including the `#` and subsequent characters, is passed to the shell
for execution. How it is handled there depends on your shell.

**Long lines can be continued using the standard Unix escape character backslash (`\`)**. It is common for commands to
be continued in this way. It is also common for lists of prerequisites to be continued with backslash.

### Summary

By now, we wrote some rules to compile and link our word-counting program. **Each of those rules defines a target, that
is, a file to be updated. Each target file depends on a set of prerequisites, which are also files. When asked to update
a target, "make" will execute the command script of the rule if any of the prerequisite files has been modified more 
recently than the target. Since the target of one rule can be referenced as a prerequisite in another rule, the set of 
targets and prerequisites form a chain or graph of dependencies (short for "dependency graph"). Building and processing this dependency graph to update the requested target is what make is all about**.

## Rules

Rules are very important in "make", there are a number of different kinds of rules.

* [**Explicit rules**](#explicit-rules), like the ones in the [previous chapter](#how-to-write-a-simple-makefile), 
  indicate a specific target to be updated if it is out of date with respect to any of its prerequisites. This is the
  most common type of rule you will be writing.
* **Pattern rules** use wildcards instead of explicit filenames. This allows make to apply the rule any time a target
  file matching the pattern needs to updated.
* **Implicit rules** are either pattern rules or suffix rules found in the **rules database** built-in to make. Having a 
  built-in database of rules makes writing Makefiles easier since for many common tasks "make" already knows the file
  types, suffixes, and programs for updating targets.
* **Static pattern** rules are like regular pattern rules except they apply only to a specific list of target files.

### Explicit Rules

Most rules you will write are explicit rules that specify particular files as targets and prerequisites. A rule can have 
more than one target. This means that each target has the same set of prerequisites as the others. If the targets are
out of date, the same set of actions will be performed to update each one. For instance:

```makefile
vpath.o variable.o: make.h config.h getopt.h gettext.h dep.h
```

This indicates that both `vpath.o` and `variable.o` depend on the same set of C header files. This line has the same 
effect as:

```makefile
vpath.o: make.h config.h getopt.h gettext.h dep.h
variable.o: make.h config.h getopt.h gettext.h dep.h
```

A rule does not have to be defined "all at once". Each time "make" sees a target file it adds the target and
prerequisites to the dependency graph. If a target has already been seen and exists in the graph, any additional 
prerequisites are appended to the target file entry in make's dependency graph. In the simple case, this is useful for breaking long lines naturally to improve the readability of the Makefile:

```makefile
vpath.o: vpath.c make.h config.h getopt.h gettext.h dep.h
vpath.o: filedef.h hash.h job.h commands.h variable.h vpath.h
```

#### Wildcards

A Makefile often contains long lists of files. To simplify this process make supports **wildcards** (also known as 
**globbing**). Makefile wildcards are identical to the Bourne shell's: `~`, `*`, `?`, `[...]`, and `[^...]`. For
instance, `*.*` expands to all the files containing a period. A question mark represents any single character, and
`[...]` represents a character class. To select the "opposite" (negated) character class use `[^...]`. In addition, the 
tilde (`~`) character can be used to represent the current user's home directory. A tilde followed by a user name 
represents that user's home directory.

#### Phony Targets

Until now all targets and prerequisites have been files to be created or updated. This is typically the case, but it is 
often useful for a target to be just a label representing a command script. For instance, earlier we noted that a
standard first target in many Makefiles is called "all:. Targets that do not represent files are known as **phony
targets**. Another standard phony target is clean:

```makefile
clean:
    rm -f *.o lexer.c
````

**Normally, phony targets will always be executed because the commands associated with the rule do not create the target 
name**.

> 📋 It is important to note that "make" cannot distinguish between a file target and phony target. If by chance the

It rarely makes sense to use a phony target as a prerequisite of a real file since the phony is always out of date and 
will always cause the target file to be remade. However, it is often useful to give phony targets prerequisites. For 
instance, the all target is usually given the list of programs to be built:

```makefile
.PHONY: all
all: bash bashbug
```

Here the all target creates the `bash` shell program and the `bashbug` error reporting tool.

By convention there are a set of more or less standard phony targets that many Makefiles include:

| **Target**  | **Function**                                                                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all`       | Perform all tasks to build the application                                       |
| `install`   | Create an installation of the application from the compiled binaries             |
| `clean`     | Delete the binary files generated from sources                                   |
| `distclean` | Delete all the generated files that were not in the original source distribution |
| `TAGS`      | Create a tags table for use by editors                                           |
| `info`      | Create GNU info files from their Texinfo sources                                 |
| `check`     | Run any tests associated with this application                                   |

> 📋 The target TAGS is not really a 
> phony since the output of the ctags and etags programs is a file named TAGS. It is included here because it is the
> only known standard

#### Variables

The simplest variables have the syntax:

```makefile
$(variable-name)
```

In general, a variable name must be surrounded by `$( )` or `${ }` to be recognized by "make". A single character
variable name, thought, does not require the parentheses.

##### Automatic Variables

**Automatic variables** are set by make after a rule is matched. There are seven "core" automatic variables:

* **`$@`** The filename representing the target.
* **`$%`** The filename element of an archive member specification.
* **`$<`** The filename of the first prerequisite.
* **`$?`** The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
* **`$^`** The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces. This list has duplicate filenames removed since 
  for most uses, such as compiling, copying, etc., duplicates are not wanted.
* **`$+`** Similar to `$^`, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated by spaces, except that `$+` includes 
  duplicates. This variable was created for specific situations such as arguments to linkers where duplicate values have 
  meaning.
* **`$*`** The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename without its suffix. (We'll discuss how stems 
  are computed later in the section "[Pattern Rules](#pattern-rules)".) Its use outside of pattern rules is discouraged.

In addition, each of the variables above has two variants for compatibility with other "makes". One variant returns only 
the directory portion of the value. This is indicated by appending a "D" to the symbol, `$(@D)`, `$(<D)`, `etc`. The
other variant returns only the file portion of the value. This is indicated by appending an "F" to the symbol, `$(@F)`, 
`$(<F)`, etc. Note that these variant names are more than one character long and so must be enclosed in parentheses. 

> 📋 Automatic variables are set by
> "make" after a rule has been matched with its target and prerequisites so **the variables are only available in the
> command script of a rule**.

Here is our [Makefile](#example) with explicit filenames replaced by the appropriate automatic variable:

```makefile
count_words: count_words.o counter.o lexer.o -lfl
    gcc $^ -o $@

count_words.o: count_words.c
    gcc -c $<

counter.o: counter.c
    gcc -c $<

lexer.o: lexer.c
    gcc -c $<

lexer.c: lexer.l
    flex -t $< > $@
```

#### Finding Files with VPATH and vpath

Our examples so far have been simple enough that the Makefile and sources all lived in a single directory. Real world 
programs are more complex (when's the last time you worked on a single directory project?). Let's refactor our example
and create a more realistic file layout. We can modify our word counting program by refactoring `main` into a function 
called "counter".

```c++
#include <lexer.h>
#include <counter.h>

void counter(int counts[4])
{
    while ( yylex() )
        ;
    counts[0] = fee_count;
    counts[1] = fie_count;
    counts[2] = foe_count;
    counts[3] = fum_count;
}
```

A reusable library function should have a declaration in a header file, so let's create `counter.h` containing our 
declaration:

```c++
#ifndef COUNTER_H_
#define COUNTER_H_

extern void counter( int counts[4] );

#endif
```

We can also place the declarations for our `lexer.l` symbols in `lexer.h`:

```c++
#ifndef LEXER_H_
#define LEXER_H_

extern int fee_count, fie_count, foe_count, fum_count;
extern int yylex( void );

#endif
```

In a traditional source tree layout the header files are placed in an "include" directory and the source is placed in a 
"src" directory. We'll do this and put our Makefile in the parent directory. Our example program now has the layout shown 
in figure below

![Error loading make-directory.png]({{ "/assets/img/make-directory.png" | relative_url}})

Since our source files now include header files, these new dependencies should be recorded in our Makefile so that when
a header file is modified, the corresponding object file will be updated.

```makefile
count_words: count_words.o counter.o lexer.o -lfl
    gcc $^ -o $@

count_words.o: count_words.c include/counter.h
    gcc -c $<

counter.o: counter.c include/counter.h include/lexer.h
    gcc -c $<

lexer.o: lexer.c include/lexer.h
    gcc -c $<

lexer.c: lexer.l
    flex -t $< > $@
```

Now when we run our makefile, we get:

```bash
$ make
make: *** No rule to make target `count_words.c', needed by `count_words.o'. Stop.
````

Why can't make find the source file? Because the source file is in the `src` directory, not the current directory.
Unless you direct it otherwise, "make" will look only in the current directory for its targets and prerequisites. How do 
we get make to look in the `src` directory for source files? Or, more generally, how do we tell "make" where our
source code is?

You can tell "make" to look in different directories for its source files using the **VPATH** and **vpath** features. To 
fix our immediate problem, we can add a VPATH assignment to the Makefile:

```makefile
VPATH = src
```

This indicates that "make" should look in the directory `src` if the files it wants are not in the current directory.
Now when we run our Makefile, we get:

```bash
$ make
gcc -c src/count_words.c -o count_words.o src/count_words.c:2:21: counter.h: No such file or directory make: *** [count_words.o] Error 1
```

**"make" cannot use the appropriate path to the source if you hardcode the filename path**, which is why "gcc" can't
find the `include` file this way. We can fix this latest problem by “customizing” the implicit compilation rule with the 
appropriate `-I` option:

```makefile
CPPFLAGS = -I include
```

and changing occurrences of gcc to `gcc$(CPPFLAGS)`. Now the build succeeds:

```bash
$ make
gcc -I include -c src/count_words.c -o count_words.o
gcc -I include -c src/counter.c -o counter.o
flex -t src/lexer.l > lexer.c
gcc -I include -c lexer.c -o lexer.o
gcc count_words.o counter.o lexer.o /lib/libfl.a -o count_words
```

The `VPATH` variable consists of a list of directories to search when "make" needs a file. The list will be searched for 
targets as well as prerequisites, but not for files mentioned in command scripts. The list of directories can be
separated by spaces or colons on Unix and separated by spaces or semicolons on Windows.

The `VPATH` variable is good because it solved our searching problem above, but it is a rather large hammer. "make" will 
search each directory for any file it needs. If a file of the same name exists in multiple places in the `VPATH` list, 
"make" grabs the first one. Sometimes this can be a problem.

The **vpath** directive is a more precise way to achieve our goals. The syntax of this directive is:

```makefile
vpath pattern directory-list
```

So our previous VPATH use can be rewritten as:

```makefile
vpath %.c src
vpath %.l src
vpath %.h include
```

Now we've told "make" that it should search for `.c` and `.l` files in the `src` directory and we've also added a line
to search for `.h` files in the include directory.

### Pattern Rules
