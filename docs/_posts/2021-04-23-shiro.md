## Authentication

### Authenticating Subjects

The process of authenticating a `Subject` can be effectively broken down into three steps:

#### Step 1: Collect the Subject's Submitted Principals and Credentials

```java
//Example using most common scenario of username/password pair:
UsernamePasswordToken token = new UsernamePasswordToken(username, password);

//"Remember Me" built-in: 
token.setRememberMe(true);
```

The `UsernamePasswordToken` supports the typical username/password authentication use case.

#### Step 2: Submit the Principals and Credentials

```java
Subject currentUser = SecurityUtils.getSubject();
currentUser.login(token);
```

An invocation to the `login` method effectively represents an authentication attempt.

### Step 3: Handling Success or Failure

If the `login` returns quietly, the `Subject` has been authenticated. The application thread can continue uninterrupted
and all further calls to `SecurityUtils.getSubject()` will return the authenticated Subject instance, and any calls to
`subject.isAuthenticated()` will return `true`.

But what happens if the login attempt failed? (incorrect password, for example)

Shiro has a rich runtime `AuthenticationException` hierarchy that can indicate exactly why the attempt failed. You can
wrap login in a try/catch block and catch. For example: 

```java
try {
    currentUser.login(token);
} catch ( UnknownAccountException uae ) {
    ...
} catch ( IncorrectCredentialsException ice ) {
    ...
} catch ( LockedAccountException lae ) {
    ...
} catch ( ExcessiveAttemptsException eae ) {
    ...
} ... catch your own ...
} catch (AuthenticationException ae ) {
    //unexpected error?
}

//No problems, continue on as expected...
```

### Authentication Internal

Until now, we've only looked at how to authenticate a `Subject` from within application code. Now we'll cover what
happens inside Shiro when an authentication attempt occurs.

![shiro-authentication-sequence]({{ "/assets/img/shiro-authentication-sequence.png" | relative_url}})

1. Application code invokes the `Subject.login` method, passing in the constructed `AuthenticationToken` instance
   representing the end-user's principals and credentials.
2. The `Subject` delegates to `SecurityManager` by calling `securityManager.login(token)`
3. The `SecurityManager`, delegates to its `Authenticator` by calling `authenticator.authenticate(token)`. This method
   [consults one or more `Realm` which validates the `token` ](#realm-authentication)

#### Realm Authentication

The `Authenticator` will call the `Realm.getAuthenticationInfo(token)` method. This effectively represents an
authentication attempt with the Realm's backing data source. The method, in order:

> 📋 A Realm is essentially a security-specific DAO

1. Inspects the token for identity info
2. Based on the token, looks for corresponding account data in the data source
3. [Ensures that the credentials supplied by the token matches those stored in the data store](#credential-matching)
4. If the credentials match, an
   [`AuthenticationInfo`](https://shiro.apache.org/static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/authc/AuthenticationInfo.html)
   instance is returned that encapsulates the account data in a format Shiro understands, otherwise an `AuthenticationException` is thrown

Realms are free to do whatever they want during this method, such as record the attempt in an audit log, update data
records, or anything else that makes sense for the authentication attempt for that data store.

##### Credential Matching

A Realm has to verify that the Subject credentials (e.g. password) must match the credentials stored in the data store.
If they match, authentication passes.

> ⚠️ It is each Realm's responsibility to match submitted credentials with those stored in the Realm's backing data
> store, and not the `Authenticator's` responsibility. Each `Realm` has intimate knowledge of credentials format and
> storage and can perform detailed credentials matching, whereas the `Authenticator` is a generic workflow component.
