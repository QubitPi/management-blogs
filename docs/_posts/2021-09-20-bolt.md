The Bolt network protocol is a highly efficient, lightweight client-server protocol designed for database applications.

The protocol is statement oriented, allowing a client to send statements, each consisting of a single string and a set
of typed parameters. The server responds to each request with a result message and an optional stream of result records.

## Overview

This section describes the Bolt Protocol, version 1.

The Bolt Protocol is a client-server protocol where messages are exchanged between a client who drives an interaction
and a server that processes and responds to client requests. Every exchange of messages is initiated by the client with
one or more request messages; in turn these requests are consumed by the server and corresponding response messages are
returned.

The diagram below illustrates a typical interaction including the order of messages sent and the life spans of the
session and job (which are described in more detail in other chapters).

The protocol is divided into two layers

1. [Bolt Transport Layer](#bolt-transport-layer), and 
2. [Messaging layer](#messaging-layer)

## Bolt Transport Layer

The protocol supports both regular [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) and
[WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) transport layers for sending and receiving messages. The transport
layer is versioned along with the rest of the Bolt Protocol and is responsible for:

* Negotiating Bolt Protocol version
* Establishing and terminating sessions
* Routing messages from clients to specific sessions and back

### Sessions

Each connection to the server creates a new **session** that lives until that connection is closed. Each session is
isolated and the server keep track of the current state, based on the requests and responses exchanged within that
session.

### Connecting

To begin a new session, the client connects using either a regular socket or a WebSocket. Once connected, both transport
layers can be treated identically.

If the server has been configured to enable encryption, TLS, the connections need to be made using a secure socket or a
secure WebSocket.

A regular socket connection should be made to the host and port the server has been configured to use for its regular
socket listener. The default port for regular socket connections is **7687**.

### Handshake

In the handshake, the client first sends a magic four byte preamble (6060 B017) followed by four protocol versions it
supports, in order of preference. The proposal is always represented as four 32-bit unsigned integers. Each integer
represents a proposed protocol version to use, or zero (`00 00 00 00`) for "none".

The server will respond with a single 32-bit unsigned integer representing the chosen protocol. This will always
represent the highest-priority protocol version the server supports. If none of the proposed protocols are supported,
the server responds with zero (`00 00 00 00`) and closes the connection.

#### Example - Initial Handshake

    Client: <connect>
    Client: 60 60 B0 17
    Client: 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00
    #  Version 1      None         None         None
    
    Server: 00 00 00 01
    #   Choose
    #  version 1

#### Example - No Supported Version

    Client: <connect>
    Client: 60 60 B0 17
    Client: 00 00 00 06  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00
    #   Version 6      None         None         None
    
    Server: 00 00 00 00
    #    None
    #  supported
    
    Server: <disconnect>

### Message Transfer Encoding

Bolt encodes each message using **chunked transfer encoding**. Each message is transferred as one or more chunks of
data. Each chunk starts with a two-byte header, an unsigned big-endian 16-bit integer, representing the size of the
chunk not including the header. A message can be divided across multiple chunks, allowing client and server alike to
transfer large messages without having to determine the length of the entire message in advance.

Each message ends with two bytes with the value `00 00`, these are not counted towards the chunk length.

#### Example - A Message in One Chunk

    Chunk size: 16
    Message data: 00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F
    
    00 10  00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F  00 00
    chunk  |                    Message                     |   End
    header |                     Data                       |  Marker

#### Example - A message Split in Two Chunks

    Chunk size: 16
    Message data: 00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F  01 02 03 04
    
    00 10  00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F  00 04  01 02 03 04  00 00
    chunk1 |                    Message                     |  chunk2 | Message |   End
    header |                     Data                       |  header |  Data   |  Marker

#### Example - Two Messages

    Chunk size: 16
    Message 1 data: 00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C  0D 0E 0F
    Message 2 data: 0F 0E 0D 0C  0B 0A 09 08
    
    00 10  00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F  00 00
    chunk  |                   Message 1                    |   End
    header |                     Data                       |  Marker
    
    00 08  0F 0E 0D 0C  0B 0A 09 08  00 00
    chunk  |       Message 2      |   End
    header |         Data         |  Marker

#### Disconnecting

A session ends when its communication socket is closed. Typically, this will be closed by the client.

## Messaging layer

This section discusses the semantic meaning and layout of protocol messages. For details on how database types are
represented in binary form, see [Message Serialization](#message-serialization).

## Message Serialization

Clients may send request messages at any time after a session is initialized. Clients may pipeline requests, sending
multiple requests together.

Servers must finish responding to each request before the next request is processed and processing of requests within a
session must be done in the same order in which the requests are sent.

Servers must ignore messages sent by the client after a failure occurs on the server, until the client has acknowledged
the failure.

For each request message sent, clients must anticipate receiving zero or more **detail messages** followed by exactly
one **summary message**. The detail messages deliver the response content, while a summary message denotes the end of
the response and any response metadata. Note that "detail" and "summary" are classifications of message, not specific
message types. For example, `RECORD` messages are classed as detail messages and `SUCCESS` messages as summary messages.

The diagrams below illustrates a basic exchange wherein the client sends a request message and receives a series of
response messages.

### Initialization

Before a session can be used to run queries, it must be initialized. The **INIT** message should be sent by the client
as the first message it sends after negotiating protocol version.

### Pipelining

The client is not required to wait for a response before sending more messages. Sending multiple messages together like
this is called pipelining:

![Error loading pipelining.png!]({{ "/assets/img/pipelining.png" | relative_url}})

For performance reasons, it is recommended that clients use pipelining as much as possible. Through pipelining, multiple
messages can be transmitted together in the same network package, significantly reducing latency and increasing
throughput.

### Failure Handling

Because the protocol leverages pipelining, the client and the server need to agree on what happens when a failure
occurs,  otherwise messages that were sent assuming no failure would occur might have unintended effects.

When requests fail on the server, the server will send the client a **FAILURE message**. The client must acknowledge the
FAILURE message by sending an **ACK_FAILURE message** to the server. Until the server receives the ACK_FAILURE message,
it will send an **IGNORED message** in response to any other message from the client, including messages that were sent
in a pipeline.

The diagram below illustrates a typical flow involving ACK_FAILURE messages:

![Error loading failure-ack.png!]({{ "/assets/img/failure-ack.png" | relative_url}})

Here, the original failure is acknowledged immediately by the client, allowing the subsequent RUN to be actioned as
expected.

This second diagram shows a sequence where a pair of request messages are sent together:

![Error loading failure-optimistic.png!]({{ "/assets/img/failure-optimistic.png" | relative_url}})

Here, the client optimistically sends a pair of messages. The first of these fails and the second is consequently
IGNORED. Once the client acknowledges the failure, it is then able to resend a corrected RUN message.

### Messages

#### INIT

```
InitMessage (signature=0x01) {
    String clientName
    Map<String,Value> authToken
}
```

* **clientName** A name and version for the client, if the user has allowed usage data collection, this is used to track
  popular clients. Example: "MyClient/1.0"
* **authToken** An authorization token used to authenticate to the database. The token must contain either just the
  entry `{ "scheme" : "none" }` or the keys scheme, principal, and credentials such as
  `{ "scheme": "basic", "principal": "user", "credentials": "secret"}`". If no scheme is provided, it defaults to
  "none".
  
The **INIT message** is a client message used once to initialize the session. This message is always the first message
the client sends after [negotiating protocol version](#handshake). Sending any message other than INIT as the first
message to the server will result in a FAILURE. As described in [Failure handling](#failure-handling) the client must
acknowledge failures using ACK_FAILURE, after which INIT may be reattempted.

Response:

* `SUCCESS {}` if initialization has completed successfully
* `FAILURE {"code": …, "message": …}` if the request was malformed, or if initialization cannot be performed at this
  time, or if the authorization failed.

Example:

    Value: INIT "MyClient/1.0" { "scheme": "basic", "principal": "neo4j", "credentials": "secret"}
