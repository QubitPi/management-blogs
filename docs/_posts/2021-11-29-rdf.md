The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing information in the Web. RDF Concepts and
Abstract Syntax defines an abstract syntax on which RDF is based, and which serves to link its concrete syntax to its
formal semantics. It also includes discussion of design goals, key concepts, datatyping, character normalization and
handling of URI references.

## RDF Concepts

RDF uses the following key concepts:

* [Graph data model](#graph-data-model)
* [URI-based vocabulary](#uri-based-vocabulary-and-node-identification)
* Datatypes
* Literals
* XML serialization syntax
* Expression of simple facts
* Entailment

### Graph Data Model

The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of **triple**s, each consisting of a **subject**, a
 **predicate** and an **object**. A set of such triples is called an **RDF graph**. This can be illustrated by a node
 and directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link (hence the term "graph").

Each triple represents a statement of a relationship between the things denoted by the nodes that it links. Each triple has three parts:

1. a subject,
2. an object, and
3. a predicate (also called a property) that denotes a relationship.

_The direction of the arc is significant: it always points toward the object._

The nodes of an RDF graph are its subjects and objects.

**The assertion of an RDF triple says that some relationship, indicated by the predicate, holds between the things
denoted by subject and object of the triple. The assertion of an RDF graph amounts to asserting all the triples in it,
so the meaning of an RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND) of the statements corresponding to all the triples it
contains**. A formal account of the meaning of RDF graphs is given in [RDF-SEMANTICS].
