Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their 
customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers 
work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a 
natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile Manifesto
---------------

### The Origin Story

In early 2001, against the backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains, in Snowbird, Utah, 17 people met to discuss the future of
software development. The group's members shared a frustration about the current state of affairs, even if they
disagreed about how to remedy the situation.

The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on excessively planning and documenting their software
development cycles that they lost sight of what really mattered - pleasing their customers.

Companies may have touted corporate values like "excellence" and "integrity," but these values did little to guide
people - especially software developers - toward a better way. That needed to change. Many of the Snowbird 17 already
had ideas about how to usher in software developmentâ€™s new era. The trip to the mountains was their chance to hash it
out.

The Agile Manifesto emerged from this extended weekend at just 68 words, and the short and sweet document went on to
change software development forever. In the nearly two decades since its creation, these words (and the 12 principles
that follow) have been embraced (in varying degrees) by countless individuals, teams, and companies.

> **[Original Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for Agile Software Development**
> 
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have
> come to value:
> 
> * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 
> * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation 
> * **Responding to change** over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
> 
> **Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto**
> 
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's
>    competitive advantage.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter 
     timescale.
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get
>    the job done.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face 
>    conversation. 
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a 
>    constant pace indefinitely.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
> 10. Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior 
>     accordingly.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be 
achieved.

### What is Sprint Planning?

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be 
delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole
scrum team.

In scrum, the sprint is a set period of time where all the work is done. However, before you can leap into action you
have to set up the sprint. You need to decide on how long the time box is going to be, the sprint goal, and where you're 
going to start. The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by setting the agenda and focus. If done correctly, it 
also creates an environment where the team is motivated, challenged, and can be successful. Bad sprint plans can derail
the team by setting unrealistic expectations.

* **The What** - The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to
  that goal. The scrum team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to
  make that happen.
* **The How** - The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. Ultimately, the resulting
  sprint plan is _a negotiation between the development team and product owner_ based on value and effort.
* **The Who** - You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development team. The product owner
  defines the goal based on the value that they seek. The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot 
  deliver that goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost impossible.
* **The Inputs** - A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product **backlog** as it provides a list of
  'stuff' that could potentially be part of the current sprint. The team should also look at the existing work done in
  the increment and have a view to capacity.
* **The Outputs** - The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the team can describe the goal of 
  the sprint and how it will start working toward that goal. This is made visible in the sprint backlog.
