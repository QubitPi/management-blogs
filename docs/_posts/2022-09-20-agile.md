Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their 
customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers 
work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a 
natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile Manifesto
---------------

### The Origin Story

In early 2001, against the backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains, in Snowbird, Utah, 17 people met to discuss the future of
software development. The group's members shared a frustration about the current state of affairs, even if they
disagreed about how to remedy the situation.

The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on excessively planning and documenting their software
development cycles that they lost sight of what really mattered - pleasing their customers.

Companies may have touted corporate values like "excellence" and "integrity," but these values did little to guide
people - especially software developers - toward a better way. That needed to change. Many of the Snowbird 17 already
had ideas about how to usher in software development's new era. The trip to the mountains was their chance to hash it
out.

The Agile Manifesto emerged from this extended weekend at just 68 words, and the short and sweet document went on to
change software development forever. In the nearly two decades since its creation, these words (and the 12 principles
that follow) have been embraced (in varying degrees) by countless individuals, teams, and companies.

> **[Original Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for Agile Software Development**
> 
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have
> come to value:
> 
> * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 
> * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation 
> * **Responding to change** over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
> 
> **Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto**
> 
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's
>    competitive advantage.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter 
     timescale.
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get
>    the job done.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face 
>    conversation. 
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a 
>    constant pace indefinitely.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
> 10. Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior 
>     accordingly.


Scrum
-----

### Scrum Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions
for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is
built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. _Rather than provide people with detailed
instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions_.

**Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making 
decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.**

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of 
people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

#### Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

1. **Commitment** The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other
2. **Focus** Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals
3. **Openness** The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges
4. **Respect**  Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by
   the people with whom they work
5. **Courage**  The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

#### Scrum Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of

1. One Product Owner, and
2. Developers.

Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one 
objective at a time, the Product Goal.

##### Developers

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.

The Developers are always accountable for:

* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
* Holding each other accountable as professionals.

##### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team and 
also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

* Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
* Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the 
Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

### Sprints

#### What are Sprints?

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very 
heart of scrum and agile methodologies. With scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called **sprints** that
break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces

> Many associate scrum sprints with agile software development, so much so that scrum and agile are often thought to be 
> the same thing. They're not. Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting it done.
> 
> The many similarities between agile values and scrum processes lead to a fair association. Sprints help teams follow
> the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to 
> change over following a plan." The scrum values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation are complementary to agile 
> and central to the concept of sprints.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be 
achieved.

#### What is Sprint Planning?

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be 
delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole
scrum team.

In scrum, the sprint is a set period of time where all the work is done. However, before you can leap into action you
have to set up the sprint. You need to decide on how long the time box is going to be, the sprint goal, and where you're 
going to start. The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by setting the agenda and focus. If done correctly, it 
also creates an environment where the team is motivated, challenged, and can be successful. Bad sprint plans can derail
the team by setting unrealistic expectations.

* **The What** - The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to
  that goal. The scrum team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to
  make that happen.
* **The How** - The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. Ultimately, the resulting
  sprint plan is _a negotiation between the development team and product owner_ based on value and effort.
* **The Who** - You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development team. The product owner
  defines the goal based on the value that they seek. The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot 
  deliver that goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost impossible.
* **The Inputs** - A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product **backlog** as it provides a list of
  'stuff' that could potentially be part of the current sprint. The team should also look at the existing work done in
  the increment and have a view to capacity.
* **The Outputs** - The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the team can describe the goal of 
  the sprint and how it will start working toward that goal. This is made visible in the sprint backlog.

#### Prep for Sprint Planning Meeting

Running a great sprint planning event requires a bit of discipline. The product owner must be prepared, combining the 
lessons from the previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback, and vision for the product, so they set the scene for the 
sprint. For transparency, the [product backlog](#backlogs) should be up-to-date and refined to provide clarity. Backlog 
refinement is an optional event in scrum, because some backlogs don't need it. However, for most teams, it's better to
get the team together to review and refine the backlog prior to sprint planning.

> **Backlog Refinement**
> 
> Product Backlog refinement is the act of **adding detail, estimates, and order to items** in the Product Backlog.  But 
> Scrum doesn't prescribe how you do it, and for good reason: Refinement is an ongoing process. It never stops because 
> requirements and opportunities never stop changing.  Detailing everything up front would create waste and also delay
> the delivery of value.
> 
> **Different products and different teams will have unique needs in terms of frequency, techniques, and level of
> detail.**

> 📋 If you have a two-week sprint, run a backlog refinement meeting in the middle of the sprint. It's great for the
> team to step back from the sprint and look at what's next. Not only does it help prepare for sprint planning, but also 
> can give a different perspective for the current work.

#### Setting a Time Limit for Sprint Planning

Sprint planning should be constrained no more than two hours for each week of the sprint. So, for example, the sprint 
planning meeting for a two-week sprint would be no longer than four hours. This is called "**timeboxing**", or setting a 
maximum amount of time for the team to accomplish a task, in this case, planning the sprint. If the team is happy before 
the timebox is finished, then the event is over. A timebox is a maximum time allowed; there is no minimum time allowed.

> 📋 Focus the first part of sprint planning on the objective of the sprint rather than the details of the backlog. By 
> focusing on the goal rather than the work it is possible to find smart alternatives for how that goal is achieved.

#### Focus on the Outcomes, Not the Work

During sprint planning it is easy to get 'bogged down' in the work focusing on which task should come first, who should
do it, and how long will it take. For complex work, the level of information you know at the start can be low, and much
of it is based on assumptions. Scrum is an empirical process, meaning that you can't plan upfront, but rather
[learn by doing](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays?attributes=customer-centricity), and then feed that 
information back into the process.

The sprint goal describes the objective of the sprint at a high level, but the backlog Items can also be written with an 
outcome in mind. User stories are one great way of describing the work from a customer point of view.
[User stories](#user-stories), written like the one below, re-focus defects, issues, and improvements on the outcome the 
customer is seeking rather than the observed problem.

![Error loading user-story-definition.svg]({{ "/assets/img/user-story-definition.svg" | relative_url}})

By adding clear, measurable results to the user story, the outcomes can be clearly measured, and you know when you are 
done. By getting as much up-front clarity as possible on the work the team is focusing on, everyone gets the
transparency needed to get started on the work. For example, leaving things vague is much worse than describing
something as a question to be answered during the sprint.

> 📋 Not knowing something is different from being vague. Don't ignore the unknowns, they are the reality of doing 
> difficult work. But don't hide them by using vague words. Instead, be clear when you don't know something and frame
> the work in terms of gaining an understanding.

#### Estimates are Required but Do Not Pretend You Know More Than You Do

Sprint planning requires some level of [estimation](#story-points-and-estimation). The team needs to define what can or 
cannot be done in the sprint: estimated effort vs capacity. Estimation is often confused with commitments. Estimates are 
by their very nature forecasts based on the knowledge at hand. Techniques such as story points or t-shirt sizing add
value to the process by giving the team a different way of looking at the problem. They are not, however, magical tools 
that can find out the truth when there is none to be found. The more unknowns, the less likely the estimate will be
correct.

Good estimation requires a trust-based environment where **information is given freely**, and assumptions are discussed
in the pursuit of learning and improvement. _If estimates are used in a negative, confrontational way after the work is 
completed, then it's likely that future estimates will be either be much bigger to ensure they never are wrong again_ or 
the time taken to create them will be much longer as the team second guesses itself worrying about the implications of 
getting them wrong.

> 📋 Explore using different estimation techniques such as t-shirt sizing or story points. Different techniques might 
> provide different views of the problem.

#### Sprint Planning Best Practices

It is easy to get so bogged down in the details of sprint planning you forget that the focus of sprint planning is to 
build a 'just enough' plan for the next sprint. That plan shouldn't become a monkey for the team's back, instead, it 
should focus the team on valuable outcomes, and allow guardrails for self-organization. A good sprint plan motivates 
everyone by defining an outcome and a clear plan for success. But be careful planning too upfront.  Instead of building 
the most complete, "every minute of the sprint is accounted for" sprint plan, focus on the goal and build enough of a 
sprint backlog to get started. Next, ensure that the product backlog is ordered to allow the team to pick up work if
they delivered on the sprint goal early.

Scrum is a process framework aimed at solving complex problems. Complex problems require an empirical process
([learning by doing](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays?attributes=customer-centricity)). Empirical processes 
are very hard to plan, so don't kid yourself--you can't build the perfect plan. Instead, **focus on the outcomes and get 
going**. It does not have to be hard, even if the problem you are solving is.

### Backlogs

#### What is a Product Backlog?

### Standups

#### What is a Stand-Up in Scrum?

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, 
adjusting the upcoming planned work. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Scrum Team.

The meeting's flavor is unique to each team as long as their it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces
an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management. At Atlassian, for example, 
they use three simple questions to generate structure:

* What did I work on yesterday?
* What am I working on today?
* What issues are blocking me?

These questions highlight progress and help flag team blockers. Also, it strengthens the team when everyone shares the 
progress they're contributing to the team. The daily reinforcement of sharing individual successes and plans keeps 
everyone excited about the team's overall contribution to the organization. Daily Scrums improve communications,
identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings

#### What Makes a Great Stand-up

1. **Choose a time that works for everyone** - Most stand-ups for co-located teams happen between 9 and 10 a.m. It gives 
   everyone time to get context for the day and doesn't require everyone to be an early riser on the team.
2. **Keep stand-up efficient** - Rotate who keeps time to make sure everyone is accountable and invested. Limit the 
   duration of stand-ups to 15 mins–max. Have a smaller team? Make it a practice to keep the stand-up even shorter.
3. **Play catch** - The Jira team tosses a beachball between team members to keep everyone engaged. No one can toss the 
   ball to someone next to them or to someone who has already gone. No zoning out! If you haven't tried the technique, 
   it's a great way to keep everyone involved.
4. **Make the stand-up a part of the team's retrospective** - Stand-ups are part of the data-driven culture. Recording
   data around them provides opportunities for improving effectiveness of stand-ups. Use these data to make stand-ups
   better for the team. If the team isn't finding value in a stand-up, discuss why. Make some changes! Stand-ups are
   agile too.
