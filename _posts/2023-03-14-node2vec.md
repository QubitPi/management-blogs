node2vec is an algorithmic framework for representational learning on graphs. Given any graph, it can learn continuous 
feature representations for the nodes, which can then be used for various downstream machine learning tasks.

Motivation
----------

_Learning useful representations_ from highly structured objects such as graphs is useful for a variety of machine
learning applications. Besides reducing the engineering effort, these representations can lead to greater predictive
power. The **node2vec** framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a
neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accomodates for various definitions of 
network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks. Specifically, it provides a way of balancing the 
exploration-exploitation tradeoff that in turn leads to representations obeying a spectrum of equivalences from
homophily to structural equivalence.

After transitioning to node $$\mathit{v}$$ from $$\mathit{t}$$, the return hyperparameter, $$\mathit{p}$$ and the inout 
hyperparameter, $$\mathit{q}$$ control the probability of a walk staying inward revisiting nodes ($$\mathit{t}$$),
staying close to the preceeding nodes ($$\mathit{x_1}$$), or moving outward farther away ($$\mathit{x_2}$$,
$$\mathit{x_3}$$).

For example, the graph visualization below depicts the color-coded communities exhibiting homophily discovered by
_node2vec_ in the Les Misérables Network.

### The Skip-Gram Model

The skip-gram neural network model is actually surprisingly simple in its most basic form. Let's start with a simple
example.

We're going to train a neural network to do the following. Given a specific word (the input word) in the middle of a
sentence, look at the words nearby and pick one at random. The network is going to tell us the probability for every
word in our vocabulary of being the "nearby word" that we chose.

> When I say "nearby", there is actually a "window size" parameter to the algorithm. A typical window size might be 5,
> meaning 5 words behind and 5 words ahead (10 in total).

The output probabilities are going to relate to how likely it is to find each vocabulary word nearby our input word. For
example, if we give the trained network the input word "Soviet", the output probabilities are going to be much higher
for words like "Union" and "Russia" than for unrelated words like "watermelon" and "kangaroo".

We’ll train the neural network to do this by feeding it "word pairs" found in our training documents. The example below
shows some of the training samples (word pairs) we would take from the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
dog." I've used a small window size of 2 just for the example. The word highlighted in blue is the input word.

The network is going to learn the statistics from the number of times each pairing shows up. So, for example, the
network is probably going to get many more training samples of ("Soviet", "Union") than it is of
("Soviet", "Sasquatch"). When the training is finished, if we give it the word "Soviet" as input, then it will output a
much higher probability for "Union" or "Russia" than it will for "Sasquatch".

#### The Model

We know we can't feed a word just as a text string to a neural network, so we need a way to represent the words to the 
network. To do this, we first build a vocabulary of words from our training documents - let's say we have a vocabulary
of 10,000 unique words.

We're going to represent an input word like "ants" as a
[one-hot vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot#:~:text=In%20natural%20language%20processing%2C%20a,uniquely%20to%20identify%20the%20word.).
This vector will have 10,000 components (one for every word in our vocabulary) and we'll place a "1" in the position 
corresponding to the word "ants", and 0's in all of the other positions.

The output of the network is a single vector (also with 10,000 components) containing, for every word in our vocabulary,
the probability that a randomly selected nearby word is that vocabulary word.

Here's the architecture of our neural network.

There is no activation function on the hidden layer neurons, but the output neurons use _softmax_.

When training this network on word pairs, the input is a one-hot vector representing the input word and the training
output is also a one-hot vector representing the output word. But when you evaluate the trained network on an input
word, the output vector will actually be a probability distribution (i.e., a bunch of floating point values, not a
one-hot vector).
