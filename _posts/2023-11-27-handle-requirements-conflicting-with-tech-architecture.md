As a systems designer, we may encounter situations where the requirements from our stakeholders or clients conflict with
the technical architecture of our system. For example, they may ask for features that are incompatible with our chosen 
technology stack, or they may demand unrealistic performance or scalability goals. How can we handle these conflicts and 
deliver a system that meets both the business and technical needs? In this article, we will explore some strategies and 
techniques that can help us deal with conflicting requirements in systems design.

Identify the Sources of Conflict
--------------------------------

To handle conflicting requirements, the first step is to identify the sources of conflict and understand why they 
exist. These sources can range from a lack of communication or alignment between stakeholders and designers, to 
changing or evolving requirements during the development process, to different perspectives or preferences of 
stakeholders or designers. External factors or dependencies, such as regulations, standards, market trends, competitors,
or existing systems can also contribute to conflict. Identifying these sources can help clarify the problem and the 
context, avoiding unnecessary arguments or misunderstandings.

Prioritize and Negotiate the Requirements
-----------------------------------------

The next step to handle conflicting requirements is to prioritize and negotiate them with the stakeholders and the 
designers. This involves analyzing the impact and feasibility of each requirement on the technical architecture, using 
techniques such as cost-benefit analysis or risk analysis. Additionally, we can classify the requirements according to 
their importance and urgency, using frameworks such as MoSCoW or Kano. Furthermore, communication and collaboration with
the stakeholders and designers is necessary to reach a consensus on the requirements. Brainstorming, voting, or 
compromise can be used to facilitate the discussion and resolve conflicts. Lastly, documenting and validating the agreed
requirements is essential, utilizing user stories, use cases, diagrams, or specifications to capture and communicate 
them. By doing so, we can balance business and technical needs while delivering a system that meets expectations and 
constraints.

Adapt and Evolve the Technical Architecture
-------------------------------------------

The final step to handle conflicting requirements is to adapt and evolve the technical architecture to accommodate them. 
This involves applying principles and practices of good systems design, such as modularity, abstraction, cohesion, 
coupling, or scalability. Additionally, leveraging the strengths and capabilities of our technology stack, such as 
frameworks, libraries, or patterns can help implement the requirements efficiently and effectively. Refactoring or 
redesigning the technical architecture as needed, based on feedback and validation from stakeholders and designers can 
improve quality and performance of the system. Ultimately, by adapting and evolving the technical architecture we can 
ensure that the system meets requirements and delivers desired outcomes and benefits.
