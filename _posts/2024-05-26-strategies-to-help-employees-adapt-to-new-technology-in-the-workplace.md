Companies should digitally transform themselves to thrive in today's rapidly-changing world. However, they may face 
stiff resistance from employees when adopting new tech.

<!--more-->

There are many reasons workers resist new technology, including:

- Feeling excluded from the decision-making process.
- Lack of communication from management.
- Failing to see the benefits.
- Resenting perceived interference from management.
- Lack of confidence around technology.
- Failing to see a use for it.
- Feeling threatened and unappreciated.

Asking Employees for Their Input
--------------------------------

Let's start by tackling the first reason workers resist new technology: feeling excluded from the decision-making
process.

Before you rush out and buy new tech, you need to consult your employees. This doesn't have to be a formal interview.
For instance, you could:

- **Send a questionnaire to employees** about the tech they currently use and what would make their job easier. Is their 
  solution the same as yours? Your idea of the best team task management software may not be the same as that of your 
  employees. Use software such as Qualtrics or SurveyMonkey to create easily accessible surveys that can be sent across 
  the company. By sending a questionnaire straight to employees' inboxes, you can quickly collect valuable feedback on 
  what software would benefit them most.
- **Optimize tech for each employee**

Asking employees for their input not only increases the likelihood of them using the new tech but also shows that you 
appreciate them. And employees who feel appreciated are more productive.

Communicating the Benefits
--------------------------

This strategy combats two causes of worker resistance:

- Lack of communication from management.
- Failing to see the benefits of new technology.

Transparency is vital when bringing in tech that affects how employees do their job. Open dialog is the best way to 
promote transparency and ease the transition from old to new.

Consider hosting a video meeting to communicate the benefits of the new technology and encourage questions and feedback 
so you can deal with any issues that may arise.

After the meeting, provide a place where employees can continue to ask questions and where you can provide updates. 
Create a group on the instant messaging software you use in-house and send regular email updates to keep employees in
the loop.

But many businesses are failing to promote transparency through open dialog. There's a big difference between companies 
that outperform their rivals and those that don't.

Employees are more likely to accept new tech if you answer the question, "What's in it for me?" So, if you think cloud 
computing will make remote sales management easier, tell people! Explain how the new tech will benefit them, and do your 
best to address their concerns.

This is particularly important with less tech-savvy employees since they're the ones who'll feel the most unsettled.

Recruiting Tech-Savvy Volunteers
--------------------------------

Let's imagine you're looking to adopt software to help build your affiliate marketing sales funnel. Recruiting a few 
volunteers from your marketing team to try out the software could answer questions like:

- How easy is it to use the software?
- How will the software benefit the marketing team?
- What's the best way to sell it to the rest of the team?
- Will it create new challenges or address existing ones?

Use these insights to shape how you go about the rest of your rollout.

You can also use these tech-savvy volunteers to promote the new technology to their colleagues. Maybe they could be the 
ones to host the video meeting to introduce the technology to the team. This will minimize any resentment employees feel 
about your perceived interference in how they work. These volunteers can also help with the next strategy: providing 
adequate training.

Providing Adequate Training
---------------------------

Training boosts employees' confidence around unfamiliar tech and makes them more likely to accept it. You should
schedule training sessions both during and after the introduction of the new tech to help everyone get familiar with it. 
But remember - when it comes to learning, there's no such thing as one-size-fits-all

Here are some more training tips to think about:

- **Make training fun**. Employees will retain more information if the training is enjoyable. They're also more likely 
  to attend!
- **Split training up**. Don't give employees all the training in one go. Splitting training into shorter chunks will 
  help keep them engaged. Consider using microlearning software as employees can learn and test their knowledge in small
  bite-size chunks.
- **Create an SOP**. Create a standard operating procedure document that employees can refer to if they forget any of 
  the training.

If in doubt, think about what helps you learn. And then do that.

Use Guided Learning
-------------------

Don't sit employees down and talk at them for two hours. Hold workshops that combine training with doing. For example, 
instructors could give employees bite-sized chunks of information. Then employees could try it out for themselves. This 
kind of guided learning helps employees remember what to do because they've actually done it.

Tailor workshops by individual, so employees only learn what they need for their job, not everyone else's.

You should also bear in mind that some employees are less tech-savvy than others. If your company is adopting a cloud 
communications platform, some employees will know all about it, while others will be wondering, "what is cloud 
communications"?

This is a good time to bring in your tech-savvy volunteers. Pair them with colleagues who are less confident with 
technology so they can help their colleagues get up to speed. 

Let Employees Learn on Their Own
--------------------------------

Some employees need hand-holding at every stage during training. Others learn best on their own. In fact, more and more 
workers in all age groups want fully independent learning.

So it's important to facilitate self-guided learning. You can do this by:

- Creating playground environment
- **Providing online resources** for employees to work through if they need a refresher. Try to provide a mixture of 
  resources, like step-by-step guides, infographics, audio recordings, and videos. All of these could be managed through
  a learning management system (LMS) which will help keep track of all training and enable you to identify any areas 
  where you can improve.

Giving Employees a Reason to Use It
-----------------------------------

Sometimes employees may still need convincing of the need to use new technology. Ongoing training can help with this, 
but so can applying the principles of A/B testing ideas (comparing one version of an asset with another) to your 
rollout. You might try:

- **Holding a workshop** where everyone tries out the new tech and compares it to the old. A virtual classroom is a 
  useful option. It provides an engaging environment for learners to develop their skills and enables you to gather 
  vital data on how successful the training is.
- **Having a friendly competition** where one team uses the old tech and one team uses the new tech to see which is 
  better. Use training software with integrated gamification with leaderboards and reward badges for encouraging 
  employees to participate.

Providing incentives for people to use the new tech can also help. A small bonus or even an office trophy could be all 
it takes to encourage people to try it out. And keeping up a dialog will help you quickly address any concerns or 
issues. 

Celebrating Success
-------------------

Just as your company should have a customer-centric culture, it should also have an employee-centric culture. This means
celebrating success, no matter how small. If an employee does something in record time because of the new tech, make 
sure everyone knows about it! Your marketing department can promote your business to employees as well as customers.

It's also important to reward employees for their contributions. Employees who make the best use of the new tech should 
be paid accordingly, especially if they boost the business's revenue.

If employees know you reward success, they'll be more motivated to adopt the new tech. They'll also be more likely to 
adopt new tech in the future.

Employees resist new technology for all sorts of reasons. Understanding those reasons is the first step to helping them 
adapt to new technology. The next step is using the tried-and-tested strategies outlined in this post
