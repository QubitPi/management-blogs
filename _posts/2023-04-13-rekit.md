React from Facebook is one of the most popular web development frameworks as of today and has fast replaced PHP, Ruby,
Python, and Angular in many areas as frameworks of choice. Apart from React, React Native too has made its way to one of
the most used technologies for mobile apps development. Due to the vast popularity of the React ecosystem as a whole,
most of the feature-rich and popular IDE and editors have been upgraded to support React and React Native in the past
couple of years.

Rekit Studio
------------

Rekit is an IDE focused specifically on developing apps using React. Rekit studio works as an IDE as well as a toolkit
that can be used for developing scalable web apps using React, react-router, and redux.

Rekit studio runs on a node server and is an npm package, and for that reason, it runs in our browser. The only thing I
like about Rekit is that every react app has its own Rekit studio, so things remain simple and controlled.

The basic features like refactoring, unit tests, code generation, support for Less and Sass, react-router, command-line
tools, etc. We can also extend Rekit functionality by developing our own plugins.

### Element Diagram

Open an element from project explorer, then we can see the element diagram under the diagram tab. It provides a very
intuitive view of how an element is created or used by others. That is the complication of a module.

For example, SidePanel is a complicated component which uses many other components and actions. And it has dependencies
from other features. Maybe itâ€™s a component to refactor to become simple and easy to understand.
