What are Agile User Stories?
============================

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the
software user's perspective.

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or
customer.

The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.
Note that "customers" don't have to be external end users in the traditional sense, they can also be internal customers
or colleagues within your organization who depend on your team.

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail.
Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.

Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like scrum and kanban. In scrum, user stories are added to sprints and "burned
down" over the duration of the sprint. Kanban teams pull user stories into their backlog and run them through their
workflow. It's this work on user stories that help scrum teams get better at estimation and sprint planning, leading to
more accurate forecasting and greater agility. Thanks to stories, kanban teams learn how to manage work-in-progress
(WIP) and can further refine their workflows.

User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks like epics and initiatives. Epics are large work
items broken down into a set of stories, and multiple epics comprise an initiative. These larger structures ensure that
the day-to-day work of the development team (on stores) contributes to the organizational goals built into epics and
initiatives.
