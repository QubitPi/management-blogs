After a regular Sprint Standup meeting today, one of my team member and I had a very constructive conversation. The
team member was an intern who expressed her concern about employee's conduct. I told her that part of our team culture
is *freedom of speech and conduct*. Stepping offline after the conversation, I wish I could thank her about raising her
true concerns, because she reminded me about a very important work that I, as a leader, must execute - "shaping team
culture"

A company's culture can be difficult to define as it is so intangible and immeasurable. In fact, some might say that 
culture is best explained by the feeling you get when you walk around the office, or worksite that best represents 
culture. It is this feeling which represents the totality of values, assumptions, and accepted norms and that is what 
affects the behaviours of individuals. For such behaviours to become engrained throughout the organisation, executive 
leaders must be the primary examples and set the standard to which others can follow.

Building team culture takes intention, dedication, and passion. It also requires specific leadership skills and strategic
initiatives that create the conditions for good teams to flourish and thrive. It takes a lot of self-work, mentorship, 
nurturing, planning, and tweaking, but the payoffs are monumental. Not only are you creating growth, joy, and
fulfillment in the lives of others, it isn’t possible to take your company to the next level without investing in your 
team.

To create successful teams, learn more about team culture, why it matters, and how to grow it below.

What is Team Culture?
---------------------

Building team culture begins with defining what your team culture is. In general, "culture" is created by shared
customs, behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs within a particular group of people. For this reason, team culture varies 
among companies and even individual teams within organizations. In terms of who creates team culture, this depends on
the leaders of each group. While they might have some company standards, the person guiding the team is ultimately in 
charge of building and fostering relationships among individuals.

How to Create Team Culture on the Team You're Leading
-----------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of ways leaders on their respective teams can build team culture in a way that positively impacts the
lives of employees and the business itself. Overall, the key is growing personal connections, which executives, 
directors, managers, and team leaders are all responsible for doing. To get a few ideas on how to do this, check out the 
tips below.

### Finding the Right People for the Right Jobs

Having the right team players is one of the most important parts of building the right culture. This process begins long 
before the hiring process. First, leaders in charge of building teams must strategize for each individual job and the 
duties for these positions.

Pre-addressing specific roles to be filled and which person would be best suited to those roles helps leaders build 
productive, organized teams. Creating job descriptions and responsibilities with real people in mind helps business 
owners and managers think strategically about the teams they’re building.

When building out individual team member positions, leaders should think about:

- Who would be an ideal fit and why?
- How can the company create a positive work experience for this person?
- What are the motivating factors of this job for the employee?
- Where is there room for flexibility (remote work, salary, time off, benefits, and more)?
- What do growth and development look like for this person?

Getting better insight into the mind of an ideal team member might also include researching personality types. By doing 
this, business owners and hiring managers take the guesswork out of who they're hiring and how they might fit into the 
organization.

Creating a strategy around new team members helps identify the qualities needed for a thriving company. Building these 
key ideas into a job description also shows potential employees that the business cares about and values the person they
select.

### Loving Your People and Take Care of Them

Renowned author and speaker, Simon Sinek, compares leadership to parenting. Like parents, a leader’s responsibility 
consists of teaching, supporting, correcting, listening, caring for, and developing people. In an interview shared on 
his YouTube channel, he says being a leader is “a lifestyle and it comes number one with the commitment that I’m 
responsible for the life of another human being.” 

Creating a positive team culture begins at the top. Leadership in the workplace means taking responsibility for ensuring 
your team members are well cared for. 

Combating negative team culture starts here:

- Valuing employees as individuals.
- Creating opportunities for growth and development within the company.
- Connecting with and viewing team members beyond their job titles.
- Helping employees achieve the best version of themselves.
- Encouraging work-life balance.
- Increasing your emotional intelligence.
- Opening lines of communication.
- Inspiring and motivating by speaking to people's hearts, minds, and spirits. 

Like being a parent, leadership is a challenging job requiring consistent education and guidance. Finding a business 
mentor, having a support network, and taking learning into your own hands are all ways to become equipped to better look
after your team. 

### Making *Company Purpose* the Guiding Force of the Organization 

People want purpose-driven work. This factor is central to a company’s team culture and overall success

With this in mind, every move the business makes needs to loop back to the “why” of the organization. As a leader 
building positive team culture, tie company objectives and goals to their purpose and value. Doing this will help 
employees know they’re working toward a collective goal that benefits others. 

### Encouraging Innovation

Innovation doesn’t always come from the top, but the top creates the right environment for it to thrive. Employees at 
innovative companies aren’t afraid of making mistakes because their leaders treat error and failure as learning 
experiences rather than a cause for termination. This secures a workplace environment of trust and support.
