Communication
-------------

Communication is critical to team success. Regular communication builds trust and develops rapport between managers and 
employees. Since teamwork involves groups of individuals performing tasks simultaneously in hopes of reaching a unified 
goal, it is important that every collaborator know where others are in the process.

When leaders fail to convey important details, adequately explain instructions, or lay out clear expectations, workers 
under-perform. Lack of communication is a common cause of employee frustration, but establishing firm lines of 
communication makes teams more efficient and team members feel more valued and confident.

Managers should check-in with staff regularly, even if only to verify that there are no urgent matters to discuss. 
Selecting the proper means of communication is also important. For instance, if there are no pressing updates, an instant
message might suffice rather than a meeting. If a manager must pass on a great deal of important information, then a 
well-formatted email may be the best method.

A good leader sets standards for communication and models those behaviors for the team. Setting a professional tone in 
conversations and sharing information promptly encourages employees to follow suit.
