Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java
application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create
simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are
defined as standard Java components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do. The Quartz Scheduler
includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering.

## A Quick Look at Quartz'

```java
SchedulerFactory schedulerFactory = new org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory();

Scheduler scheduler = schedulerFactory.getScheduler();

scheduler.start();

// define the job and tie it to our HelloJob class
JobDetail job = newJob(HelloJob.class)
        .withIdentity("myJob", "group1")
        .build();

// Trigger the job to run now, and then every 40 seconds
Trigger trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("myTrigger", "group1")
        .startNow()
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
            .withIntervalInSeconds(40)
            .repeatForever()
        )
        .build();

// Tell quartz to schedule the job using our trigger
scheduler.scheduleJob(job, trigger);
```

The key interfaces of the Quartz API are:

* `Scheduler` - the main API for interacting with the scheduler.
* `Job` - an interface to be implemented by components that you wish to have executed by the scheduler.
* `JobDetail` - used to define **instances** of Jobs.
* `Trigger` - a component that defines the schedule upon which a given Job will be executed.
* `JobBuilder` - `JobDetail` instances "factory", which creates instances of Jobs.
* `TriggerBuilder` - `Trigger` instances "factory".

A Scheduler's life-cycle is bounded by it's creation, through a `SchedulerFactory`, and a call to its `shutdown()`
method. Once created the `Scheduler` interface can be used add, remove, and list `Jobs` and `Triggers`, and perform
other scheduling-related operations (such as pausing a trigger). However, the `Scheduler` will not actually act on any
triggers (execute jobs) until it has been started with the `start()` method, as shown in the example above.

Quartz provides "builder" classes that define a Domain Specific Language, for example

```java
// define the job and tie it to our HelloJob class
JobDetail job = newJob(HelloJob.class)
        .withIdentity("myJob", "group1") // name "myJob", group "group1"
        .build();

// Trigger the job to run now, and then every 40 seconds
Trigger trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("myTrigger", "group1")
        .startNow()
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
            .withIntervalInSeconds(40)
            .repeatForever()
        )            
        .build();

// Tell quartz to schedule the job using our trigger
sched.scheduleJob(job, trigger);
```

### Identities

`Jobs` and `Triggers` are given identifying keys as they are registered with the Quartz scheduler. The keys of `Jobs`
and `Triggers` (`JobKey` and `TriggerKey`) allow them to be placed into 'groups' which can be useful for organizing your
jobs and triggers into categories such as "reporting jobs" and "maintenance jobs". The name portion of the key of a job
or trigger must be unique within the group - or in other words, the complete key (or identifier) of a job or trigger is
the compound of the name and group.

## Job (type) & JobDetail (instance)

A `Job` is a class that implements the Job interface, which has only one simple method:

```java
package org.quartz;

public interface Job {

    void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException;
}
```

When the Job trigger fires (more on that in a moment), **the `execute()` method is invoked by one of the scheduler's
worker threads**. The `JobExecutionContext` object that is passed to this method provides the job instance with
information about its "run-time" environment - a handle to the Scheduler that executed it, a handle to the `Trigger`
that triggered the execution, the `JobDetail` object, and a few others.

The `JobDetail` object is created at the time the `Job` is added to the scheduler. It contains various property settings
for the `Job`, as well as a [`JobDataMap`](#jobdatamap), which can be used to store state information for a given instance of your job
class. It is essentially the definition of the job instance

**A `JobDetail` is an instance of `Job` class**. Each `JobDetail` is associated with an unique ID called `JobKey`. Keys
are composed of both a name and group, and the name must be unique within the group. Quartz offers API to construct
`JobKey`: `JobKey.jobKey(String name, String group)`.

A `Job` instance, i.e. `JobDetail`, can be re-executed. The instance can be retrieved at anytime by key using
`Scheduler.getJobDetail(JobKey)`

`JobDetail` is crated by `JobBuilder` class with

```java
JobDetail job = newJob(HelloJob.class)
        .withIdentity("myJob", "group1") // name "myJob", group "group1"
        .build();
```

where the job class `HelloJob` defined as such:

```java
public class HelloJob implements Job {

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Trigger

Trigger objects are used to trigger the execution of jobs. When you schedule a job, you instantiate a trigger and "tune"
its properties to provide the scheduling you wish to have. 

Note that a `JobDetail` can be triggered immediately via `Scheduler.triggerJob(JobKey)`;

### Misfire Instructions

An important property of a Trigger is its "misfire instruction". A misfire occurs if a persistent trigger "misses" its
firing time because of the scheduler being shutdown, or because there are no available threads in Quartz thread pool.
The different trigger types have different misfire instructions available to them. By default they use a "smart policy"
instruction - which has dynamic behavior based on trigger type and configuration. When the scheduler starts, it searches
for any persistent triggers that have misfired, and it then updates each of them based on their individually configured
misfire instructions. You should make yourself familiar with the misfire instructions that are defined on the given
trigger types, and explained in their JavaDoc.

All triggers have the `Trigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_SMART_POLICY` instruction set as default

#### When Are Misfire Instructions Useful?

For testing purposes, we would like to change system time to adjust the Quartz's triggering schedule, one issue arises
when we change the system time to sometime during which a trigger is not supposed to fire, but in some cases Quartz
scheduler still triggers automatically during that time. 

This is because when we change the system date, Quarts realizes that it has missed the job that should have been
triggered and will therefore fire off that job immediately.

To solve the issue, we use misfire instruction, such as 

```java
(ScheduleBuilder<T>) CronScheduleBuilder.cronSchedule("0 0 1 * * ?").withMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing();
```

The `withMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing()` overwrites the ["smart policy"](#crontrigger-misfire-instructions)
so that those misfired jobs will never be executed.

> The "smart policy" automatically "compensates" by executing all misfired jobs

### SimpleTrigger

`SimpleTrigger` should meet your scheduling needs if you need to have a job execute exactly once at a specific moment in
time, or at a specific moment in time followed by repeats at a specific interval. For example, if you want the trigger
to fire at exactly 11:23:54 AM on January 13, 2015, or if you want it to fire at that time, and then fire five more
times, every ten seconds.

#### Building SimpleTrigger

```java
// Build a trigger for a specific moment in time, with no repeats
Trigger trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger1", "group1")
        .startAt(myStartTime)     // some Date
        .forJob("job1", "group1") // identify job with name, group strings
        .build();

// Build a trigger for a specific moment in time, then repeating every ten seconds ten times
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
        .startAt(myTimeToStartFiring) // if a start time is not given (if this line were omitted), "now" is implied
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
                    .withIntervalInSeconds(10)
                    .withRepeatCount(10)) // note that 10 repeats will give a total of 11 firings
        .forJob(myJob) // identify job with handle to its JobDetail itself                   
        .build();

// Build a trigger that will fire once after five minutes
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger5", "group1")
        .startAt(futureDate(5, IntervalUnit.MINUTE)) // use DateBuilder to create a date in the future
        .forJob(myJobKey) // identify job with its JobKey
        .build();

// Build a trigger that will fire now, then repeat every five minutes, until the hour 22:00
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger7", "group1")
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
                    .withIntervalInMinutes(5)
                    .repeatForever()
        )
        .endAt(dateOf(22, 0, 0))
        .build();

// Build a trigger that will fire at the top of the next hour, then repeat every 2 hours, forever
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger8")    // because group is not specified, "trigger8" will be in the default group
        .startAt(evenHourDate(null)) // get the next even-hour (minutes and seconds zero ("00:00"))
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
                    .withIntervalInHours(2)
                    .repeatForever()
        )
        // note that in this example, 'forJob(..)' is not called
        //  - which is valid if the trigger is passed to the scheduler along with the job  
        .build();
scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger, job);
```

> Note that `TriggerBuilder` (`SimpleTrigger` instances are built using `TriggerBuilder`) will generally choose a
> reasonable value for properties that you do not explicitly set. For examples: if you don't call one of the
> `withIdentity(...)` methods, then `TriggerBuilder` will generate a random name for your trigger; if you don't call
> `startAt(...)` then the current time (immediately) is assumed

#### SimpleTrigger Misfire Instructions

`SimpleTrigger` has several instructions that can be used to inform Quartz what it should do when a misfire occurs.
These instructions are defined as constants on `SimpleTrigger` itself:

```java
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_IGNORE_MISFIRE_POLICY
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_EXISTING_COUNT
```

When building `SimpleTriggers`, you specify the misfire instruction as part of the simple schedule (via
`SimpleSchedulerBuilder`):

```java
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger7", "group1")
        .withSchedule(
            simpleSchedule()
                    .withIntervalInMinutes(5)
                    .repeatForever()
                    .withMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithExistingCount())
        .build();
```

### CronTrigger

With `CronTrigger`, you can specify firing-schedules such as "every Friday at noon", or "every weekday and 9:30 am", or
even "every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 am on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday during January"

#### Building CronTrigger

```java
// Build a trigger that will fire every other minute, between 8am and 5pm, every day
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
        .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/2 8-17 * * ?"))
        .forJob("myJob", "group1")
        .build();

// Build a trigger that will fire daily at 10:42 am
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
        .withSchedule(dailyAtHourAndMinute(10, 42))
        .forJob(myJobKey)
        .build();

// Build a trigger that will fire on Wednesdays at 10:42 am, in a TimeZone other than the system's default
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
        .withSchedule(weeklyOnDayAndHourAndMinute(DateBuilder.WEDNESDAY, 10, 42))
        .forJob(myJobKey)
        .inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles"))
        .build();
```

##### [How to Make a Cron Trigger that Triggers Between Time](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52735212)

Cron expression doesn't support arbitrary start and end time, for example, we won't be able to say "every 5 minutes
starting from 8:45am and ending at 11:23am". In order to be able to have a cron job like that, we do

```java
Trigger trigger = TriggerBuilder.newTrigger() // identity, job, etc.
        .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/5 8-10 * * ? *"))
        .startAt(/*8:45am*/)
        .endAt(/*11:23am*/)
        .build();
```

#### CronTrigger Misfire Instructions

```java
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_IGNORE_MISFIRE_POLICY
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_DO_NOTHING
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW
```

The "smart policy" instruction is interpreted by `CronTrigger` as `MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW`

When building CronTriggers, you specify the misfire instruction as part of the simple schedule (via
`CronSchedulerBuilder`):

```java
trigger = newTrigger()
        .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
        .withSchedule(
            cronSchedule("0 0/2 8-17 * * ?")
                    .withMisfireHandlingInstructionFireAndProceed()
        )
        .forJob("myJob", "group1")
        .build();
```

#### Cron Expression

**cron** is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven.
The `CronTrigger` class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.

`CronTrigger` uses "cron expressions", which are able to create firing schedules such as: "At 8:00am every Monday
through Friday" or "At 1:30am every last Friday of the month".

Cron expressions are powerful, but can be pretty confusing. This section aims to take some of the mystery out of
creating a cron expression.

##### Format

A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 **field**s separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the
allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as
follows:

| **Field Name** | **Required** | **Allowed Values** | **Allowed Special Characters** |
|:--------------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| Seconds        | YES          | 0-59               | , - * /                        |
| Minutes        | YES          | 0-59               | , - * /                        |
| Hours          | YES          | 0-23               | , - * /                        |
| Day of month   | YES          | 1-31               | , - * ? / L W                  |
| Month          | YES          | 1-12 or JAN-DEC	 | , - * /                        |
| Day of week    | YES          | 1-7 or SUN-SAT     | , - * ? / L #                  |
| Year           | No           | empty, 1970-2099   | , - * /                        |

So cron expressions can be as simple as this: `* * * * ? *` or more complex, like this:
`0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010`

##### Special Characters

* `*` ("all values") - used to select all values within a field. For example, "*" in the minute field means "every
  minute".
* `?` ("no specific value") - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character
  is allowed, but not the other. For example, if we want our trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the
  10th) but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, we would put "10" in the day-of-month field, and "?" in
  the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.
* `-` - used to specify ranges. For example, "10-12" in the hour field means "the hours 10, 11 and 12".
* `,` - used to specify additional values. For example, `MON,WED,FRI` in the day-of-week field means "the days Monday,
  Wednesday, and Friday".
* `/` - used to specify increments. For example, "0/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45". And
  "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50". 
* `L` ("last") - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value "L" in
  the day-of-month field means "the last day of the month" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years.
  If it is used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means "7" or "SAT". But if it is put right after a value
  in the day-of-week field, it means "the last x day of the month" - for example "6L" means "the last friday of the
  month". You can also specify an offset, such as "L-3" which says the third-to-last day of the calendar month. When
  using the `L` option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you will get confusing/unexpected
  results.
* `W` ("weekday") - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to
  specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, it translates to "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the
  month". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger
  will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify
  "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not
  "jump" over the boundary of a month. The `W` character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day,
  not a range or list of days.
  > The `L` and `W` characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield `LW`, which translates to
  > *"last weekday of the month"*.
* `#` - used to specify "the nth" day of the month. For example, the value of "6#3" in the day-of-week field means "the
  third Friday of the month" (day 6 = Friday and "#3" = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: "2#1" = the first
  Monday of the month and "4#5" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify "#5", then no firing will
  occur that month.
  
> The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are case in-sensitive. `MON` is the same as `mon`.

## JobDataMap

The `JobDataMap` can be used to hold any amount of (serializable) data objects which you wish to have made available to
the job instance when it executes. `JobDataMap` is an implementation of the Java `Map` interface, and has some added
convenience methods for storing and retrieving data of primitive types.

Here's some quick snippets of putting data into the `JobDataMap` while defining/building the `JobDetail`, prior to
adding the job to the scheduler:

```java
// define the job and tie it to our DumbJob class
JobDetail job = newJob(DumbJob.class)
    .withIdentity("myJob", "group1")         // name "myJob", group "group1"
    .usingJobData("jobSays", "Hello World!") // stored in JobDataMap
    .usingJobData("myFloatValue", 3.141f)    // stored in JobDataMap
    .build();
```

Here is a quick example of getting data from the JobDataMap during the job's execution

```java
public class SomeJob implements Job {

    @Override
    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        JobDataMap dataMap = context.getJobDetail().getJobDataMap();

        String jobSays = dataMap.getString("jobSays");
        float myFloatValue = dataMap.getFloat("myFloatValue");
    }
}
```

Triggers can also have `JobDataMaps` associated with them. This can be useful in the case where you have a Job that is
stored in the scheduler for regular/repeated use by multiple Triggers, yet with each independent triggering, you want to
supply the Job with different data inputs.

The `JobDataMap` that is found on the `JobExecutionContext`(as in the example above) during `Job` execution serves as a
convenience. It is a merge of the `JobDataMap` found on the `JobDetail` and the one found on the `Trigger`, with the
values in the latter overriding any same-named values in the former.

Here's a quick example of getting data from the `JobExecutionContext`'s merged `JobDataMap` during the job's execution:

```java
public class SomeJob implements Job {

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        JobDataMap dataMap = context.getMergedJobDataMap();  // Note the difference from the previous example

        String jobSays = dataMap.getString("jobSays");
        float myFloatValue = dataMap.getFloat("myFloatValue");
        ArrayList state = (ArrayList) dataMap.get("myStateData");
        state.add(new Date());
    }
  }
```

## Job State and Concurrency

There are some annotations that can be added to your `Job` class that affect `Quartz` behavior:

### @DisallowConcurrentExecution

It tells Quartz not to execute multiple instances of a given job definition (that refers to the given job class)
concurrently. The constraint is based upon an instance definition (`JobDetail`), not on instances of the job class. For
example:

```java
@DisallowConcurrentExecution
public class SomeJob implements Job {

    ...
}
```

```java
JobDetail job1 = newJob(SomeJob.class)
        .withIdentity("job1", "group1")
        .build();
```

```java
JobDetail job2 = newJob(SomeJob.class)
        .withIdentity("job2", "group2")
        .build();
```

Only 1 instance of `job1` can be executed at a given time, it `job1` can be executed concurrently with `job2`.

### @PersistJobDataAfterExecution

Update the stored copy of the `JobDataMap` in `JobDetail` after the `execute()` method completes successfully (without
throwing an exception), such that the next execution of the same job (`JobDetail`) receives the updated values rather
than the originally stored values. Like the `@DisallowConcurrentExecution` annotation, this applies to a job definition
instance, not a job class instance

> Note: If you use the `@PersistJobDataAfterExecution` annotation, you should strongly consider also using the
> `@DisallowConcurrentExecution` annotation, in order to avoid possible race conditions

## Job Stores

`JobStore` are responsible for keeping track of all the information given to the scheduler: jobs, triggers, calendars,
etc. Selecting the appropriate `JobStore` for your Quartz scheduler instance is an important step. Luckily, the choice
should be a very easy one once you understand the differences between them. You declare which `JobStore` your scheduler
should use (and it's configuration settings) in the **properties file** (or **object**) that you provide to the
`SchedulerFactory`

> Note: Never use a `JobStore` instance directly in your code. `JobStore` is for behind-the-scenes use of Quartz itself.
> You have to tell Quartz (through configuration) which `JobStore` to use, but then you should only work with the
> `Scheduler` interface in your code

### RAMJobStore

`RAMJobStore` is the simplest `JobStore` to use, it is also the most performant (in terms of CPU time). `RAMJobStore`
gets its name in the obvious way: it keeps all of its data in RAM. This is why it's lightning-fast, and also why it's so
simple to configure. The drawback is that when your application ends (or crashes) all of the scheduling information is
lost

### JDBCJobStore

`JDBCJobStore` is also aptly named - it keeps all of its data in a database via JDBC. Because of this it is a bit more
complicated to configure than `RAMJobStore`, and it also is not as fast. However, the performance draw-back is not
terribly bad

`JDBCJobStore` works with nearly any database, it has been used widely with Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
[HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/), and DB2.

### TerracottaJobStore

TerracottaJobStore provides a means for scaling and robustness without the use of a database.
