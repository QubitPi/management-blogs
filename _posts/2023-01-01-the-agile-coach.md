What is Agile?
==============

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their 
customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers
work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a 
natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. 

Whereas the traditional "waterfall" approach has one discipline contribute to the project, then "throw it over the wall"
to the next contributor, agile calls for **collaborative cross-functional teams**. Open communication, collaboration, 
adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile. Although the project lead or product owner
typically prioritizes the work to be delivered, the team takes the lead on deciding how the work will get done, 
self-organizing around granular tasks and assignments.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies 
that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.

The original Agile Manifesto didn't prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size. It simply laid out a set of
core values that put people first. The way you and your team live those values today - whether you do scrum by the book,
or blend elements of kanban and XP - is entirely up to you.


Why Choose Agile?
=================

Teams choose agile so they can **respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly** without 
derailing a year's worth of plans. "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team
gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

But it's not just a numbers game. First and foremost, **it's about people**. As described by the Agile Manifesto,
authentic human interactions are more important than rigid processes. Collaborating with customers and teammates is more 
important than predefined arrangements. And delivering a working solution to the customer's problem is more important
than hyper-detailed documentation.

> \[QubitPi\]: I personally disagree with "delivering a working solution to the customer's problem is more important
> than hyper-detailed documentation". I believe thery are **equally important** and I enforce this in my company.

An agile team unites under a shared vision, then brings it to life the way they know is best. Each team sets their own 
standards for quality, usability, and completeness. Their "definition of done" then informs how fast they'll churn the
work out. Although it can be scary at first, company leaders find that when they put their trust in an agile team, that
team feels a greater sense of ownership and rises to meet (or exceed) management's expectations.
