What is Agile?
==============

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their 
customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers
work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a 
natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. 

Whereas the traditional "waterfall" approach has one discipline contribute to the project, then "throw it over the wall"
to the next contributor, agile calls for **collaborative cross-functional teams**. Open communication, collaboration, 
adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile. Although the project lead or product owner
typically prioritizes the work to be delivered, the team takes the lead on deciding how the work will get done, 
self-organizing around granular tasks and assignments.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies 
that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.

The original Agile Manifesto didn't prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size. It simply laid out a set of
core values that put people first. The way you and your team live those values today - whether you do scrum by the book,
or blend elements of kanban and XP - is entirely up to you.


Why Choose Agile?
=================

Teams choose agile so they can **respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly** without 
derailing a year's worth of plans. "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team
gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

But it's not just a numbers game. First and foremost, **it's about people**. As described by the Agile Manifesto,
authentic human interactions are more important than rigid processes. Collaborating with customers and teammates is more 
important than predefined arrangements. And delivering a working solution to the customer's problem is more important
than hyper-detailed documentation.

An agile team unites under a shared vision, then brings it to life the way they know is best. Each team sets their own 
standards for quality, usability, and completeness. Their "definition of done" then informs how fast they'll churn the
work out. Although it can be scary at first, company leaders find that when they put their trust in an agile team, that
team feels a greater sense of ownership and rises to meet (or exceed) management's expectations.


Agile Manifesto

### The Origin Story

In early 2001, against the backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains, in Snowbird, Utah, 17 people met to discuss the future of
software development. The group's members shared a frustration about the current state of affairs, even if they
disagreed about how to remedy the situation.

The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on excessively planning and documenting their software
development cycles that they lost sight of what really mattered - pleasing their customers.

Companies may have touted corporate values like "excellence" and "integrity," but these values did little to guide
people - especially software developers - toward a better way. That needed to change. Many of the Snowbird 17 already
had ideas about how to usher in software development's new era. The trip to the mountains was their chance to hash it
out.

The Agile Manifesto emerged from this extended weekend at just 68 words, and the short and sweet document went on to
change software development forever. In the nearly two decades since its creation, these words (and the 12 principles
that follow) have been embraced (in varying degrees) by countless individuals, teams, and companies.

> **[Original Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for Agile Software Development**
>
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have
> come to value:
>
> * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> * **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>
> **Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto**
>
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's
>    competitive advantage.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter
     timescale.
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get
>    the job done.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face
>    conversation.
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a
>    constant pace indefinitely.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
> 10. Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior
>     accordingly.
