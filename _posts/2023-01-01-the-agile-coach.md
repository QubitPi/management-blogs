What is Agile?
==============

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their 
customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers
work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a 
natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. 

Whereas the traditional "waterfall" approach has one discipline contribute to the project, then "throw it over the wall"
to the next contributor, agile calls for **collaborative cross-functional teams**. Open communication, collaboration, 
adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile. Although the project lead or product owner
typically prioritizes the work to be delivered, the team takes the lead on deciding how the work will get done, 
self-organizing around granular tasks and assignments.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.
